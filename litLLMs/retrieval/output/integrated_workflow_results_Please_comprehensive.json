  "review": "# Latest Advances in Diffusion Models for Text Modality: A Comprehensive Review\n\n## Section 1: Foundations and Core Architectures of Text Diffusion Models\n\n### 1.1 Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Formulations\n\nText diffusion models represent a paradigm shift from traditional autoregressive language modeling by framing text generation as a gradual denoising process. The fundamental mathematical framework involves defining a forward process that progressively adds noise to text representations and a reverse process that learns to reconstruct coherent text from noise [1]. Unlike continuous domains like images, text operates in discrete token spaces, necessitating specialized formulations that handle categorical distributions effectively. The theoretical underpinnings draw from stochastic differential equations and Markov processes, where the forward process corrupts text embeddings through Gaussian noise addition while preserving the underlying semantic structure [2].\n\nThe mathematical formulations for text diffusion must address the challenge of operating in high-dimensional discrete spaces. Recent approaches have explored embedding-space diffusion, where noise is applied to continuous representations of tokens rather than the tokens themselves [3]. This approach maintains differentiability while enabling the application of established continuous diffusion theory. The core innovation lies in designing appropriate noise schedules and loss functions that account for the sequential nature of text, where positional information and syntactic structure must be preserved throughout the diffusion process [4]. These theoretical advances have enabled text diffusion models to overcome initial limitations in coherence and fluency that plagued early attempts at non-autoregressive text generation.\n\n### 1.2 Discrete vs Continuous Diffusion in Text Space\n\nA critical distinction in text diffusion research concerns the treatment of the underlying space—whether to operate in continuous embedding spaces or directly on discrete tokens. Discrete diffusion models work directly on token indices, defining transition matrices that specify probabilities for tokens to transition to other tokens or special mask tokens during the forward process [5]. This approach maintains the categorical nature of text but requires careful design of transition rates to ensure training stability and generation quality. Recent work has improved discrete diffusion through learned transition matrices that adapt to the semantic relationships between tokens [6].\n\nContinuous diffusion models, in contrast, operate on token embeddings, applying Gaussian noise in the continuous space and leveraging pretrained language models for the denoising process [7]. This approach benefits from well-established continuous diffusion theory but requires mapping between continuous embeddings and discrete tokens, typically through rounding or sampling operations. Hybrid approaches have emerged that combine the strengths of both paradigms, using continuous diffusion for semantic modeling while maintaining discrete decisions for final token selection [1]. The choice between discrete and continuous approaches involves trade-offs between training efficiency, generation quality, and compatibility with existing language model architectures, with recent empirical evidence suggesting that continuous approaches may offer advantages in capturing semantic nuance while discrete methods excel at syntactic precision.\n\n### 1.3 Architectural Innovations and Model Design\n\nArchitectural innovations have been crucial for adapting diffusion models to text modality. Transformer-based denoising networks have become standard, but with significant modifications to handle the iterative nature of diffusion [3]. Key innovations include time-step conditioning mechanisms that inform the model about the current noise level, enabling it to adjust its denoising strategy appropriately. Cross-attention layers have been integrated to support conditional generation tasks, allowing the model to attend to source text or other conditioning information throughout the diffusion process [2].\n\nRecent architectural advances focus on improving efficiency and scalability. Several studies have explored hierarchical designs where diffusion occurs at multiple granularities—from characters to words to phrases—enabling more efficient generation of long-form text [4]. Other innovations include latent space diffusion, where the diffusion process operates in a compressed representation space, significantly reducing computational requirements while maintaining generation quality [6]. These architectural improvements have progressively closed the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive text generation, with some benchmarks showing competitive or superior results on specific tasks like paraphrasing and style transfer [1]. The ongoing evolution of text diffusion architectures continues to address fundamental challenges in coherence maintenance, length control, and diversity-quality trade-offs that are unique to textual data.\n\n## Section 2: Advanced Training and Optimization Techniques\n\n### 2.1 Training Paradigms and Objective Functions\n\nThe training of text diffusion models has evolved beyond simple denoising score matching to incorporate more sophisticated objective functions that address text-specific challenges. Variational bounds on the negative log-likelihood provide a principled framework for training, but practical implementations often use simplified objectives that balance training stability with sample quality [8]. Recent work has explored hybrid objectives that combine diffusion losses with auxiliary losses for specific text properties like fluency, coherence, and factual accuracy [9]. These multi-task learning approaches have demonstrated improved performance on complex generation tasks where multiple text qualities must be optimized simultaneously.\n\nCurriculum learning strategies have proven particularly effective for text diffusion, where models are initially trained on simpler denoising tasks before progressing to more challenging generation scenarios [10]. This approach helps mitigate the training instability that can arise from the complex optimization landscape of text diffusion models. Another significant advancement involves adversarial training paradigms, where discriminator networks provide additional training signals to improve the naturalness of generated text [11]. These techniques complement the standard denoising objective by directly optimizing for perceptual quality metrics that correlate with human judgments of text quality. The combination of improved objective functions and sophisticated training strategies has substantially reduced the sample complexity of text diffusion models, enabling effective training with more modest computational resources [12].\n\n### 2.2 Optimization and Efficiency Techniques\n\nEfficiency remains a critical concern for text diffusion models, which typically require multiple denoising steps during generation. Recent optimization techniques have focused on reducing the number of required steps through improved sampling algorithms [13]. Knowledge distillation methods have been employed to train student models that mimic the behavior of more expensive teacher models with fewer sampling steps [11]. These approaches maintain generation quality while significantly accelerating inference, making text diffusion more practical for real-time applications.\n\nQuantization and model compression techniques have been adapted specifically for text diffusion models [10]. Weight quantization strategies carefully preserve the precision of critical components like attention mechanisms while compressing less sensitive parts of the network. Architectural optimizations, including sparse attention patterns and mixture-of-experts designs, have enabled more efficient scaling to larger model sizes without proportional increases in computational requirements [12]. These efficiency improvements are particularly important for deployment in resource-constrained environments and have facilitated the integration of text diffusion models into larger systems like conversational agents and content generation platforms [14]. The ongoing optimization of text diffusion models continues to narrow the efficiency gap with autoregressive approaches while preserving the advantages of parallel generation and better mode coverage.\n\n### 2.3 Scalability and Performance Enhancements\n\nScalability challenges in text diffusion models have been addressed through distributed training strategies and architectural innovations that improve training stability at scale [9]. Gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, and model parallelism have enabled training of larger text diffusion models than previously possible [8]. Recent work has also explored progressive growing techniques, where models are initially trained at smaller scales before being fine-tuned with increased capacity and data [13].\n\nPerformance enhancements have come from several directions, including better initialization strategies that leverage pretrained language models [11]. By starting from weights that already capture linguistic knowledge, text diffusion models achieve better performance with fewer training iterations. Multi-scale training approaches have also shown promise, where models learn to generate text at different levels of abstraction simultaneously [10]. These techniques improve the coherence of long-form generation by ensuring consistency across different granularities of text structure. The combination of scalability improvements and performance enhancements has enabled text diffusion models to tackle increasingly complex generation tasks, from multi-paragraph articles to structured technical documents, with quality approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art autoregressive methods [12].\n\n## Section 3: Applications and Specialized Domains\n\n### 3.1 Text Generation and Creative Applications\n\nText diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in creative text generation, offering advantages over autoregressive approaches in diversity and controllability [15]. In story generation, diffusion models produce more narrative-consistent texts by considering the entire sequence during generation rather than left-to-right [16]. This global planning capability enables more coherent long-range dependencies and character consistency throughout extended narratives. Poetry and creative writing applications benefit from the ability to iteratively refine generated text, allowing writers to guide the creative process through intermediate editing of partially denoised texts [17].\n\nControllable generation represents a particularly strong application area for text diffusion models [18]. By conditioning the diffusion process on specific attributes—such as sentiment, style, or topic—models can generate text with precise characteristics while maintaining fluency and coherence [19]. The iterative nature of diffusion enables progressive refinement of these attributes, allowing users to adjust conditioning signals during generation to achieve desired outcomes. This capability has proven valuable in creative applications where the target text characteristics may evolve during the creative process [15]. Recent advances have also enabled multi-attribute control, where multiple conditioning signals are combined to generate text that satisfies complex sets of constraints simultaneously [16].\n\n### 3.2 Reasoning and Problem-Solving Tasks\n\nText diffusion models have shown surprising effectiveness in reasoning tasks, particularly through their application in self-refinement frameworks [16]. The iterative denoising process naturally aligns with reasoning as a step-by-step refinement activity, where initial rough reasoning is progressively refined into cogent logical arguments [17]. In mathematical reasoning, diffusion models have been used to generate and verify step-by-step solutions, with the diffusion process enabling backtracking and correction of erroneous reasoning steps [9]. This capability represents a significant advantage over single-pass generation approaches that cannot easily recover from early errors.\n\nProblem-solving applications leverage the ability of diffusion models to explore multiple solution paths simultaneously [20]. In coding tasks, for instance, diffusion models can generate multiple implementations and iteratively refine them toward optimal solutions [15]. The latent space of text diffusion models has been found to capture semantic relationships that support analogical reasoning, enabling models to solve problems by drawing parallels to previously encountered situations [16]. These reasoning capabilities continue to improve with scale and specialized training, suggesting that text diffusion may offer a fundamentally different approach to computational reasoning compared to traditional sequence-to-sequence methods [17].\n\n### 3.3 Multimodal and Cross-Modal Applications\n\nThe integration of text diffusion with other modalities has created powerful cross-modal generation systems [19]. In text-to-image generation, diffusion models excel at producing detailed captions and descriptions that guide the image generation process [14]. The bidirectional nature of diffusion enables tight coupling between textual and visual representations, allowing iterative refinement of both modalities to achieve consistency [18]. This capability has proven particularly valuable for complex scene generation where multiple objects and relationships must be described precisely.\n\nAudio-text applications represent another growing area, with text diffusion models generating transcriptions, captions, and descriptions of audio content [15]. The alignment between the sequential nature of audio and the iterative refinement of diffusion creates natural synergies for tasks like audio captioning and descriptive transcription [20]. Video-text applications similarly benefit from the temporal modeling capabilities of diffusion, enabling generation of coherent video descriptions that maintain consistency across frames [19]. These cross-modal applications demonstrate the versatility of text diffusion as a component in larger multimodal systems, with the text generation process providing a flexible interface between different representation spaces [17].\n\n## Section 4: Evaluation, Analysis, and Future Directions\n\n### 4.1 Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarking\n\nThe evaluation of text diffusion models requires specialized metrics that capture their unique characteristics and advantages [21]. Traditional language generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, while still used, often fail to capture the full range of capabilities that diffusion models exhibit [22]. Recent work has developed diffusion-specific evaluation protocols that measure iterative refinement quality, mode coverage, and controllability in addition to standard quality metrics [23]. Human evaluation remains crucial, particularly for assessing subtle aspects of text quality like coherence, creativity, and naturalness that automated metrics struggle to capture [24].\n\nBenchmark development has accelerated to address the unique characteristics of text diffusion models [25]. New datasets specifically designed for evaluating iterative refinement capabilities and controllability have been introduced, providing more comprehensive assessment of diffusion-specific strengths [26]. These benchmarks often include tasks with explicit quality-runtime trade-offs, recognizing that the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted based on application requirements [27]. The establishment of standardized evaluation protocols has facilitated more meaningful comparisons between different text diffusion approaches and against autoregressive baselines [28]. This rigorous evaluation framework has been instrumental in identifying the specific scenarios where text diffusion models offer compelling advantages over alternative approaches [29].\n\n### 4.2 Theoretical Analysis and Limitations\n\nTheoretical analysis of text diffusion models has revealed both strengths and limitations of the approach [30]. On the positive side, diffusion models offer better theoretical guarantees regarding mode coverage and distribution learning compared to autoregressive models [31]. The connection to score matching and stochastic differential equations provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding the denoising process [32]. However, significant theoretical challenges remain, particularly around the discrete nature of text and the approximations required to make diffusion tractable in high-dimensional spaces [33].\n\nA key limitation concerns the efficiency-quality trade-off inherent in iterative denoising [34]. While reducing the number of diffusion steps improves efficiency, it can compromise sample quality, creating practical constraints for real-time applications [35]. Another theoretical limitation involves the handling of compositional structure in text, where the sequential dependencies between tokens create complex conditional distributions that are challenging to model through simple denoising [36]. Recent theoretical work has begun to address these limitations through improved understanding of the dynamics of discrete diffusion processes and their relationship to the underlying data distribution [37]. This theoretical progress has guided practical improvements while identifying fundamental constraints that may require alternative approaches [38].\n\n### 4.3 Emerging Trends and Future Research\n\nSeveral emerging trends point toward exciting future directions for text diffusion research [39]. Unified modeling approaches that combine diffusion with other generative paradigms are gaining traction, seeking to leverage the complementary strengths of different methods [27]. For instance, hybrid models that use autoregressive generation for structure and diffusion for refinement have shown promise for complex generation tasks [37]. Another trend involves the application of text diffusion to increasingly specialized domains, including legal documents, scientific writing, and technical manuals, where the controllability and iterative refinement capabilities offer particular advantages [28].\n\nFuture research directions include improving the efficiency of text diffusion through learned sampling schedules and adaptive computation [38]. There is growing interest in developing better understanding of the latent spaces learned by text diffusion models and how they capture semantic and syntactic structure [36]. The integration of external knowledge sources and reasoning capabilities represents another promising direction, potentially enabling more factual and logically consistent generation [39]. As text diffusion models continue to evolve, they are likely to play an increasingly important role in the broader ecosystem of natural language generation, offering unique capabilities that complement rather than replace existing approaches [27]. The ongoing research in this vibrant field promises to address current limitations while expanding the range of applications where diffusion-based text generation can provide value [37].\n\n##",

      "abstract": "Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.",

We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.",

      "abstract": "Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses the weights of Large Language Models (LLMs) into low-precision representations to reduce memory footprint and accelerate inference. However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.",

These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features -- including low-$\\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns -- that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum.

In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number, the sublattice polarization $\\tilde{N} = N_A - N_B$. Quantum fluctuation drives the spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic (SN) phase -- an incompressible yet phase-coherent quantum state that breaks rotational symmetry without forming a superfluid or realizing topological order.

In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2>$0.99 for M$_\\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\\sim$1700$\\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models.

      "abstract": "Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.",

Using the open topological string/spectral theory correspondence, we construct exact, analytic eigenfunctions of $H_N$, valid for arbitrary polynomial potentials and describing both bound and resonant states. Our solutions are entire in $x$ for generic values of the energy, and become $L^2$-normalizable only at a discrete set of energies. An interesting feature of these Hamiltonians is the existence of special loci in the parameter space of the potential, the so-called Toda points. The eigenfunctions exhibit enhanced decay at these points, leading to spectral degeneracies for confining potentials and to a real energy spectrum for unbounded ones. Our results provide a rare example of a quantum-mechanical spectral problem that is exactly solvable, admitting explicit, analytic eigenfunctions for both bound and resonant states.",

To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses.

Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.",

      "abstract": "The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.",

For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.",

By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\\approx 2.95σ$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $Λ$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict.

LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.",

Despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries, Instella achieves state-of-the-art results among fully open models and is competitive with leading open-weight models of comparable size. We further release two specialized variants: Instella-Long, capable of handling context lengths up to 128K tokens, and Instella-Math, a reasoning-focused model enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on mathematical tasks. Together, these contributions establish Instella as a transparent, performant, and versatile alternative for the community, advancing the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research.",

      "abstract": "Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.",

      "abstract": "Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$. Surprisingly, despite non-convexity, our methodology does not require any constraint qualifications, can handle hidden convex equality constraints, and achieves complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.",

While there are typically standard distances to adopt in a continuous space, this is not the case for combinatorial parameters such as graphs that represent statistical models. Existing proposals like the structural Hamming distance are defined on the graphs rather than the models they represent and can hence lead to undesirable behaviors. We propose a model-oriented framework for defining the distance between graphs that is applicable across many different graph classes. Our approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes the graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion. This induces a neighborhood structure, from which we define the model-oriented distance as the length of a shortest path through neighbors, yielding a metric in the space of graphs. We apply this framework to both probabilistic graphical models (e.g., undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs) and causal graphical models (e.g., directed acyclic graphs and maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs). We analyze the theoretical and empirical behaviors of model-oriented distances. Algorithmic tools are also developed for computing and bounding these distances.",

      "abstract": "The interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom is a prominent feature of many quantum materials and of particular interest in systems with strong ferroelectric fluctuations, such as SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and KTaO$_3$ (KTO). Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons.",

Our framework is general, extending the notion of SCP to include both conventional variants such as trust-region, convex-concave, and prox-linear methods, and algorithms that combine convex subproblems with rounding steps, as in relaxing and rounding schemes. Unlike existing analyses that may only provide local guarantees under limited conditions, our framework delivers global worst-case guarantees--quantifying how well an SCP algorithm performs across all problem instances in the specified family. Applications in control, signal processing, and operations research demonstrate that our framework provides, for the first time, global worst-case guarantees for SCP algorithms in the parametric setting.",

Our proposed SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.",

Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.",

We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.",

Working under mass action kinetics, we obtain two complementary structural results for every $n\\geq 2$. First, opening any nonempty subset of the substrate species preserves the network's capacity for nondegenerate multistationarity. Second, opening the enzyme species (both kinase and phosphatase), possibly together with any subset of substrates, always destroys multistationarity. The latter result is proved by a general reduction framework combining the detection of absolute concentration robustness (ACR) with projection onto the remaining species; when the projection is monostationary, the full semi-open system is monostationary. We also illustrate the general method on multi-layer cascade variants and discuss biological implications: opening enzymes acts as a robust switch that converts a potentially multistationary phosphorylation module into a monostationary one, while substrate exchange preserves switching capacity and thus the ability to couple cycles to downstream processes.",

This paper presents a novel Multitask Glocal OBIA-Mamba (MSOM) for enhanced Sentinel-2 classification with the following contributions. First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "We introduce a novel mechanism where the kinetic energy of a rotating axion can be dissipated by the interactions with dark magnetic monopoles. This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities.",

      "abstract": "We carry out a complete analysis of the toric elliptic and genus-one fibrations of all 474 million reflexive polytopes in the Kreuzer-Skarke database. Earlier work with Huang showed that all but 29,223 of these polytopes have such a fibration. We identify 2,264,992,252 distinct fibrations, and determine the fiber and base structure in each case; after accounting for automorphisms of the ambient polytope, these fibrations furnish 2,250,744,657 equivalence classes. We summarize generic features and identify exotic special cases among these fibrations. These fibrations illustrate many features that have been explored in the context of 6D F-theory, including gauge groups hosted on non-toric divisors, automatic enhancement of gauge groups, and implicit non-toric bases and high-rank 6D SCFTs associated with nonflat fibers, as well as novel geometric features such as singular bases for genus-one fibrations with multisections. This analysis illustrates the power of elliptic and genus-one fibrations, and the geometro-physical language of F-theory as a tool for understanding the structure of Calabi-Yau threefolds.",

      "abstract": "Self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) is a fundamental tool in Bayesian inference when the posterior distribution involves an unknown normalizing constant. Although $L_1$-error (bias) and $L_2$-error (root mean square error) estimates of SNIS are well established for bounded integrands, results for unbounded integrands remain limited, especially under randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. In this work, we derive $L_p$-error rate $(p\\ge1)$ for RQMC-based SNIS (RQMC-SNIS) estimators with unbounded integrands on unbounded domains. A key step in our analysis is to first establish the $L_p$-error rate for plain RQMC integration. Our results allow for a broader class of transport maps used to generate samples from RQMC points. Under mild function boundary growth conditions, we further establish \\(L_p\\)-error rate of order \\(\\mathcal{O}(N^{-β+ ε})\\) for RQMC-SNIS estimators, where $ε>0$ is arbitrarily small, $N$ is the sample size, and \\(β\\in (0,1]\\) depends on the boundary growth rate of the resulting integrand. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.",

      "abstract": "Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.",
