  "review": "# The Rise of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models: Architectural Paradigms, Scaling Laws, and Cross-Domain Applications (2024-Present)\n\n## 1 Introduction: The New Frontier of Spatio-Temporal Intelligence\n\nSpatio-temporal prediction represents one of the most challenging and consequential problems in artificial intelligence, encompassing the forecasting of phenomena that evolve across both space and time dimensions. From traffic flow and weather patterns to disease spread and environmental monitoring, the ability to accurately predict spatio-temporal dynamics has profound implications across numerous scientific and industrial domains [1]. The core challenge lies in effectively modeling the complex interplay between spatial autocorrelation—where nearby locations exhibit similar characteristics—and temporal dynamics that may include seasonality, trends, and complex nonlinear dependencies. Traditional approaches have typically relied on specialized architectures tailored to specific domains, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial grid data, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for temporal sequences, and graph neural networks (GNNs) for irregular spatial structures [2].\n\nThe historical paradigm of task-specific modeling has proven increasingly inadequate for addressing the scale and complexity of modern spatio-temporal problems. These specialized models suffer from limited generalization capabilities, requiring extensive retraining and architectural modifications when applied to new domains or even slightly different tasks within the same domain. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in real-world scenarios where data distributions may shift over time or where models must adapt to previously unseen spatial configurations. The computational inefficiency of training separate models for each prediction task further compounds these challenges, especially given the exponential growth in spatio-temporal data from sources such as satellite networks, IoT sensors, and urban monitoring systems [3].\n\nThe year 2024 has marked a transformative paradigm shift with the emergence of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) and Large Spatio-Temporal Models (LSTMs), representing a fundamental reimagining of how we approach spatio-temporal intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision, STFMs are characterized by their massive scale, extensive pre-training on diverse spatio-temporal datasets, and ability to perform zero-shot or few-shot adaptation to a wide range of downstream prediction tasks [4]. These models aim to capture universal patterns and representations that transcend specific domains, enabling unprecedented generalization capabilities and reducing the need for task-specific engineering. The distinction between STFMs and LSTMs, while sometimes blurred, generally reflects a spectrum where STFMs serve as generalized backbones for representation learning, while LSTMs typically incorporate additional reasoning capabilities and operate at even larger scales [5].\n\nThis comprehensive review synthesizes and critically analyzes the rapid advancements in spatio-temporal foundation models since 2024, with particular emphasis on architectural innovations, scaling properties, and emergent capabilities. We establish a coherent taxonomy to navigate the diverse landscape of approaches, provide detailed methodological comparisons across multiple dimensions, and examine cross-domain applications that demonstrate the transformative potential of these models. Through extensive case studies and critical analysis, we aim to chart both the current state of the field and its future trajectories, while highlighting the significant challenges that remain unresolved.\n\n## 2 Foundational Concepts and a Unifying Taxonomy\n\n### 2.1 Core Architectural Components of STFMs\n\nThe architectural foundation of modern spatio-temporal models rests on three fundamental components: spatial encoders, temporal encoders, and fusion mechanisms that integrate these representations. Spatial encoders have evolved significantly beyond traditional CNNs, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) becoming increasingly prominent for handling irregular spatial structures such as road networks, sensor placements, and geographic features. The most recent innovation in this space comes from the integration of State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, which offers compelling advantages for capturing long-range spatial dependencies [1]. The OBIA-Mamba approach exemplifies this trend, utilizing superpixels as Mamba tokens within a global-local framework to efficiently model spatial relationships while reducing computational redundancy.\n\nTemporal encoders have similarly undergone substantial evolution, moving from recurrent architectures like LSTMs and GRUs toward transformer-based models that can capture complex temporal dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. However, the quadratic complexity of standard transformers has prompted the development of more efficient alternatives, including temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and most recently, temporal SSMs that maintain linear scaling with sequence length [6]. These advancements are particularly crucial for spatio-temporal prediction, where modeling long-term dependencies is often essential for accurate forecasting.\n\nThe fusion problem—how to effectively combine spatial and temporal representations—represents one of the most challenging aspects of STFM design. Early fusion approaches combine raw spatial and temporal inputs at the input level, while late fusion processes spatial and temporal patterns independently before combining them at the output stage. Intermediate fusion, which has gained prominence in recent architectures, integrates spatial and temporal representations throughout the network, allowing for more nuanced interactions between these modalities [7]. The Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA) exemplifies an innovative approach to fusion, performing multi-scale integration directly in the latent space rather than in pixel space, thereby achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining representation quality.\n\n### 2.2 Defining the Spectrum: From Specialized to Foundational\n\nThe distinction between specialized models, spatio-temporal foundation models, and large spatio-temporal models requires careful delineation based on specific criteria. We propose that a model qualifies as a foundation model if it demonstrates: (1) pre-training on massive, diverse spatio-temporal datasets spanning multiple domains; (2) parameter counts sufficient to capture complex spatio-temporal patterns (typically >100M parameters); (3) task-agnostic representations that support zero-shot or few-shot adaptation; and (4) emergent abilities not explicitly programmed during training [4]. Large Spatio-Temporal Models (LSTMs) represent a further evolution, characterized by even greater scale (typically >1B parameters) and often incorporating integrated reasoning capabilities that enable more sophisticated understanding of spatio-temporal phenomena [8].\n\nWithin this spectrum, hybrid architectures have emerged as particularly promising approaches that integrate STFMs with other modalities such as vision and language [5]. These models leverage the complementary strengths of different foundation models, enabling more comprehensive understanding of complex spatio-temporal scenarios. For instance, vision-augmented STFMs can incorporate satellite imagery and ground-level photos to enrich spatial representations, while language-augmented variants can interpret textual context to inform temporal predictions. The SmolVLM2 architecture demonstrates how such integration can be achieved even under resource constraints, making foundation model capabilities accessible for applications with limited computational resources [5].\n\nOur proposed taxonomy differentiates between three primary categories: Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) as generalized backbones for representation learning; Large Spatio-Temporal Models (LSTMs) with enhanced scale and reasoning capabilities; and Hybrid Architectures that integrate STFMs with other modalities. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for understanding the diverse landscape of approaches and their respective strengths and limitations, which we will explore in detail throughout this review.\n\n## 3 Architectural Paradigms for Large-Scale Spatio-Temporal Learning\n\n### 3.1 The Transformer Ascendancy and Its Scalability Challenge\n\nThe transformer architecture, which revolutionized natural language processing, has similarly transformed spatio-temporal modeling through its ability to capture complex dependencies across both spatial and temporal dimensions. When applied to spatio-temporal data, transformers typically treat each spatial location at each time step as a token, allowing the model to learn rich interactions through self-attention mechanisms. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success in domains ranging from traffic prediction to climate modeling, where capturing long-range dependencies is crucial for accurate forecasting [4].\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of transformers in spatio-temporal domains has revealed significant scalability challenges. The self-attention mechanism at the core of transformers exhibits quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, making it computationally prohibitive for applications involving high-resolution spatial data or long temporal sequences. This limitation becomes particularly acute in real-world scenarios such as city-wide traffic prediction or continental-scale weather forecasting, where both spatial and temporal dimensions can be extensive. The memory requirements for storing attention matrices grow exponentially, constraining the practical applicability of vanilla transformers to relatively small-scale problems [6].\n\nRecent efforts to address these limitations have focused on developing efficient attention variants, including sparse attention patterns, linear attention approximations, and hierarchical approaches that process data at multiple resolutions. While these methods have achieved notable improvements in efficiency, they often come at the cost of representational capacity or require careful engineering to maintain performance. The fundamental tension between computational efficiency and modeling capacity remains a central challenge in transformer-based spatio-temporal modeling, prompting exploration of alternative architectural paradigms that can overcome these limitations [1].\n\n### 3.2 The State Space Model (SSM) Revolution\n\nThe emergence of State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, represents a paradigm shift in sequential modeling with profound implications for spatio-temporal prediction. SSMs draw inspiration from classical control theory, modeling sequential data through latent states that evolve over time according to learned dynamics. The key innovation in modern SSMs lies in their parameterization of these dynamics as input-dependent processes, enabling the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the current context [1]. This selective mechanism allows SSMs to maintain long-range dependencies while operating with linear complexity in sequence length, addressing a fundamental limitation of transformer architectures.\n\nThe mathematical foundation of SSMs centers on continuous-time systems described by linear ordinary differential equations, which are then discretized for digital computation. This continuous-time perspective provides theoretical advantages for modeling irregularly sampled temporal data, a common characteristic of real-world spatio-temporal datasets where measurements may be missing or collected at varying intervals. The discretization process involves learned parameters that control how much information from previous states is retained, creating a dynamic memory mechanism that adapts to the input sequence [1].\n\nA compelling case study of SSM application in spatio-temporal domains is the OBIA-Mamba architecture for Sentinel-2 landcover mapping [1]. This approach introduces several innovative elements: first, it employs superpixels generated through Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) as tokens for the Mamba model, effectively reducing computational redundancy while preserving fine-grained spatial details. Second, it implements a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch architecture that combines CNN-based local feature extraction with Mamba-based global context modeling. Third, it incorporates a multitask optimization framework that balances local precision with global consistency through dual loss functions. Empirical results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior classification accuracy compared to transformer-based alternatives while requiring significantly less computational resources, highlighting the practical advantages of SSMs for large-scale spatio-temporal applications [1].\n\n### 3.3 Latent Space Manipulation for Efficiency\n\nThe paradigm of latent space manipulation has emerged as a powerful strategy for enhancing the efficiency of spatio-temporal models while maintaining representational quality. Traditional approaches to tasks such as super-resolution or scale adaptation typically operate in pixel space, requiring expensive computations across high-dimensional representations. Recent advances have demonstrated that performing these operations in compressed latent spaces can achieve comparable quality with substantially reduced computational requirements [7].\n\nThe Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA) represents a groundbreaking approach in this direction, performing super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final decoding step [7]. This architecture employs a shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads that support both 2x and 4x upscaling factors. By operating in the latent space, LUA avoids the computational overhead of processing high-resolution pixel arrays while maintaining perceptual quality comparable to pixel-space methods. The efficiency gains are substantial: LUA reduces decoding and upscaling time by nearly 3x compared to traditional super-resolution approaches, adding only 0.42 seconds for 1024px generation from 512px inputs versus 1.87 seconds for pixel-space alternatives [7].\n\nThe implications of latent space manipulation extend beyond image super-resolution to broader spatio-temporal prediction tasks. In weather and climate modeling, for instance, similar approaches could enable efficient downscaling of global climate predictions to regional or local scales without the computational expense of running high-resolution physical simulations. The principle of performing computationally intensive operations in compressed latent representations represents a generalizable strategy for scaling spatio-temporal models to higher resolutions and larger domains while maintaining practical computational requirements [7].\n\n### 3.4 Simulation-Based Inference as a Pre-Training Paradigm\n\nSimulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training spatio-temporal models, particularly in domains where real-world data is scarce, expensive to acquire, or lacks comprehensive ground truth. SBI leverages physically realistic simulations to generate synthetic training data that captures the essential dynamics of the target system, enabling models to learn robust representations without extensive real-world supervision [9].\n\nThe Synference framework for galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting provides an exemplary case study of SBI applied to a complex spatio-temporal-like problem [9]. This approach trains a neural posterior estimator on 10^6 simulated galaxies based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, enabling rapid inference of galaxy properties from multi-band photometry. The amortized inference achieved by Synference is exceptionally efficient, processing entire galaxy samples in approximately 3 minutes on a single CPU—a 1700x speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques [9]. This dramatic acceleration demonstrates the potential of SBI for enabling real-time or near-real-time spatio-temporal prediction in domains where traditional inference methods would be computationally prohibitive.\n\nThe relevance of SBI to spatio-temporal foundation models lies in its potential as a pre-training paradigm. By training on diverse simulations that capture fundamental physical principles, STFMs can develop generalizable representations that transfer effectively to real-world data. This approach is particularly valuable in domains such as climate science, urban planning, and epidemiology, where comprehensive simulations exist but real-world observations may be limited or noisy. The success of Synference in astrophysics suggests that similar approaches could be fruitfully applied to Earth-scale spatio-temporal problems, leveraging physical simulations to bootstrap foundation model capabilities [9].\n\n## 4 The Scaling Law: Data, Compute, and Emergent Abilities\n\n### 4.1 The Drive for Scale: Parameter Count and Training Data\n\nThe scaling hypothesis—that model performance improves predictably with increases in model size, dataset size, and computational resources—has been dramatically validated in natural language processing and computer vision, and is now being tested in spatio-temporal domains. The Instella language model family demonstrates this principle in adjacent domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance through careful scaling of model parameters and training data despite using fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries [4]. This success has inspired similar scaling efforts in spatio-temporal modeling, with recent STFMs pushing parameter counts into the hundreds of millions and training on petabytes of diverse spatio-temporal data.\n\nThe curation of massive, heterogeneous spatio-temporal datasets presents unique challenges compared to language or image data. Spatio-temporal datasets often exhibit complex dependencies across multiple scales, irregular sampling patterns, and significant missing data. Furthermore, the integration of diverse data sources—from satellite imagery and IoT sensor networks to traffic cameras and social media feeds—requires sophisticated preprocessing and alignment techniques to create coherent training corpora [3]. The temporal dimension introduces additional complexities, as models must handle non-stationary distributions, concept drift, and varying sampling rates across different data sources.\n\nThe computational requirements for training large-scale STFMs are substantial, often requiring distributed training across hundreds or thousands of accelerators for extended periods. The ParoQuant quantization method offers promising directions for mitigating these requirements through pairwise rotation quantization that evens out magnitude across channels and narrows dynamic range within quantization groups [6]. This approach achieves 2.4% accuracy improvement over previous quantization methods with less than 10% overhead, making large-scale spatio-temporal model deployment more practical. Such efficiency improvements are crucial for enabling broader access to STFM capabilities, particularly for resource-constrained applications or organizations [6].\n\n### 4.2 Evidence of Emergent Abilities\n\nAs spatio-temporal foundation models scale in size and training data, researchers have begun observing emergent abilities—capabilities that arise unexpectedly without explicit programming or training. These emergent properties mirror phenomena observed in large language models, where scaling enables qualitatively new behaviors such as reasoning, in-context learning, and compositional understanding [8]. In spatio-temporal domains, emergent abilities may manifest as zero-shot spatial interpolation, where models can predict values at unobserved locations based on patterns learned from different geographic contexts; temporal extrapolation beyond training distributions; and cross-domain transfer, where representations learned from one domain (e.g., traffic patterns) prove effective in unrelated domains (e.g., disease spread).\n\nThe Socratic Self-Refine (SSR) framework, though developed for language model reasoning, offers a compelling blueprint for how emergent reasoning capabilities might be cultivated in spatio-temporal models [8]. SSR decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. Applied to spatio-temporal prediction, similar approaches could enable models to identify and refine unreliable components of their forecasts, leading to more accurate and interpretable predictions. The empirical success of SSR across multiple reasoning benchmarks suggests that structured refinement mechanisms may be essential for unlocking the full potential of emergent reasoning in complex domains [8].\n\nAnother promising direction for emergent abilities in STFMs involves the integration of causal reasoning frameworks that enable models to understand not just correlations but underlying causal mechanisms in spatio-temporal systems. The Resonance Principle proposes that genuine causal understanding emerges in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions, modeled as networks of weakly coupled oscillators where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes [10]. While developed in the context of neural processing, this principle may inform the design of STFMs that can reason about interventions and counterfactuals in complex spatio-temporal systems, moving beyond pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of dynamical processes [10].\n\n### 4.3 The Critical Role of Efficient Scaling\n\nThe pursuit of scale in spatio-temporal foundation models must be balanced against practical constraints of computational resources, energy consumption, and deployment scenarios. Efficient scaling strategies have therefore become a critical focus of research, with innovations in model compression, quantization, and distillation playing essential roles in making large models practically usable [6]; [11].\n\nBlack-box on-policy distillation represents a particularly promising approach for transferring capabilities from large teacher models to more efficient student models without access to the teacher's internal parameters or logits [11]. The Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD) framework frames the student model as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher's, creating a minimax game that drives improvement. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success in language domains, with distilled models achieving performance comparable to much larger teachers on automatic evaluation metrics [11]. Applied to spatio-temporal domains, similar distillation techniques could enable the deployment of foundation model capabilities in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices, drones, or mobile sensors, dramatically expanding the practical applicability of STFMs.\n\nQuantization methods like ParoQuant further enhance efficiency by compressing model weights into low-precision representations while minimizing accuracy degradation [6]. The presence of outliers in weights and activations presents particular challenges for quantization, especially in reasoning models where errors accumulate across long chains of computation. ParoQuant addresses this through pairwise rotation quantization combined with channel-wise scaling, achieving significant accuracy improvements over previous methods with minimal inference overhead. These advances in efficient scaling are not merely optional optimizations but essential enablers for the practical deployment of spatio-temporal foundation models across diverse real-world applications [6].\n\n## 5 A Detailed Comparative Analysis of Methodologies\n\n### 5.1 Comparison Framework\n\nTo enable systematic comparison across the diverse landscape of spatio-temporal foundation models, we establish a comprehensive framework based on six key dimensions: (1) Architectural Family (Transformer, SSM, Hybrid, etc.); (2) Core Innovation (novel components or training paradigms); (3) Scalability (time and space complexity characteristics); (4) Handling of Long-Range Dependencies (mechanisms for capturing extended spatial and temporal contexts); (5) Primary Application Domain (environmental, urban, biomedical, etc.); and (6) Key Limitations (computational requirements, data dependencies, or domain restrictions). This framework allows us to identify patterns across different approaches and understand the trade-offs involved in architectural decisions.\n\nThe comparative analysis reveals distinct clusters of methods optimized for different scenarios. Transformer-based approaches excel in scenarios requiring rich interaction modeling across spatial and temporal dimensions but struggle with computational complexity at scale. SSM-based methods offer compelling alternatives for long-sequence modeling with linear complexity but may require careful design to capture complex spatial relationships. Hybrid architectures attempt to combine the strengths of multiple approaches but introduce additional complexity in training and deployment. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for selecting appropriate architectures for specific spatio-temporal prediction tasks [1].\n\n### 5.2 In-Depth Method vs. Method Analysis\n\n#### Transformer-based vs. SSM-based Architectures\n\nThe comparison between transformer-based and SSM-based approaches represents one of the most significant architectural decisions in contemporary spatio-temporal modeling. Transformer architectures, with their self-attention mechanisms, excel at capturing complex, non-local dependencies across both space and time. This makes them particularly well-suited for tasks requiring rich contextual understanding, such as predicting complex urban dynamics or understanding intricate climate patterns. However, their quadratic complexity imposes practical limits on sequence length, constraining their application to high-resolution spatial data or long temporal histories [4].\n\nIn contrast, SSM-based approaches like Mamba offer linear scaling with sequence length, making them capable of handling extremely long spatio-temporal sequences that would be computationally prohibitive for transformers. The OBIA-Mamba architecture demonstrates this advantage in landcover mapping, where it processes high-resolution satellite imagery efficiently by treating superpixels as tokens [1]. The selective state space mechanism in Mamba allows it to dynamically focus on relevant context while ignoring irrelevant information, a property particularly valuable in spatio-temporal domains where only certain spatial or temporal contexts may be relevant for prediction at a given location and time.\n\nThe key differentiators between these approaches extend beyond computational complexity to their fundamental inductive biases. Transformers impose minimal structural assumptions, allowing them to learn complex dependency patterns from data but requiring substantial training data to do so effectively. SSMs incorporate stronger structural priors through their state space formulation, which can be advantageous in data-limited scenarios or when modeling systems with known dynamical characteristics. In practice, the choice between these architectures depends on the specific requirements of the application, including sequence length, available training data, and the complexity of dependencies that must be captured [1].\n\n#### Latent-Space Efficiency vs. Pixel-Space Methods\n\nThe comparison between latent-space and pixel-space operations represents another critical dimension in spatio-temporal model design, with significant implications for efficiency and scalability. Traditional pixel-space methods operate directly on high-dimensional raw data, providing fine-grained control but requiring substantial computational resources. The Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA) exemplifies the latent-space alternative, performing super-resolution in compressed representations before final decoding [7].\n\nThe efficiency advantages of latent-space methods are substantial: LUA reduces decoding and upscaling time by nearly 3x compared to pixel-space alternatives while maintaining comparable perceptual quality [7]. This efficiency gain becomes increasingly important as model resolutions scale, making latent-space approaches particularly valuable for applications requiring high-resolution predictions over large spatial extents, such as regional climate modeling or city-scale urban simulation.\n\nHowever, latent-space methods introduce their own challenges, particularly regarding interpretability and control. Operations in latent space are less transparent than their pixel-space counterparts, making it difficult to understand how specific manipulations affect the final output. Additionally, the compression inherent in latent representations may lose fine-grained details that could be important for certain applications. The choice between latent-space and pixel-space approaches therefore involves trade-offs between efficiency and transparency, with the optimal balance depending on the specific requirements of the application [7].\n\n#### Simulation-Based vs. Real-Data Driven Pre-training\n\nThe paradigm for pre-training spatio-temporal foundation models represents another fundamental axis of variation, with simulation-based and real-data driven approaches offering complementary advantages and limitations. Simulation-based approaches, exemplified by Synference in astrophysics, leverage physically-based models to generate synthetic training data that captures the essential dynamics of the target system [9]. This approach offers several advantages: virtually unlimited training data, perfect ground truth labels, and the ability to explore rare or extreme scenarios that may be poorly represented in real-world datasets.\n\nHowever, simulation-based pre-training faces the fundamental challenge of the sim-to-real gap—discrepancies between simulated and real data that can limit model performance when deployed in real-world settings. These discrepancies may arise from simplifications in the physical models, imperfect parameterizations, or missing processes in the simulations. Bridging this gap requires careful calibration of simulations against real observations and may involve domain adaptation techniques to align representations between simulated and real domains [9].\n\nReal-data driven pre-training avoids the sim-to-real gap by learning directly from observational data, but faces challenges of data scarcity, noise, and incomplete ground truth. In many spatio-temporal domains, comprehensive real-world datasets are difficult or expensive to acquire, and may lack the diversity needed for robust generalization. Furthermore, observational data often contains systematic biases and missing values that can distort learned representations if not properly addressed [3].\n\nThe most promising approaches may combine both paradigms, using simulation-based pre-training to establish foundational understanding of physical principles followed by fine-tuning on real-world data to adapt to observational characteristics. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods while mitigating their respective limitations, offering a path toward models that are both physically consistent and practically effective [9].\n\n#### Specialized vs. General-Purpose Models\n\nThe tension between specialized and general-purpose models represents a recurring theme in machine learning, with particular relevance to spatio-temporal prediction. Specialized models, such as those optimized for UAV path planning in post-disaster scenarios, are highly optimized for specific tasks and domains, often achieving state-of-the-art performance within their narrow scope [2]. These models can incorporate domain-specific inductive biases and exploit task-specific structure to achieve high efficiency and accuracy.\n\nHowever, specialized models suffer from limited generalization capabilities, requiring extensive re-engineering when applied to new domains or even slightly different tasks within the same domain. This limitation becomes particularly problematic in real-world scenarios where requirements may evolve over time or where models must adapt to changing conditions. The development and maintenance of multiple specialized models for different spatio-temporal prediction tasks can also be resource-intensive and impractical for organizations with diverse needs [2].\n\nGeneral-purpose spatio-temporal foundation models offer an alternative approach, aiming to develop unified representations that transfer across domains and tasks. These models sacrifice some degree of task-specific optimization in exchange for broader applicability and reduced need for custom engineering. The emergence of zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in foundation models further enhances their practical value, enabling adaptation to new tasks with minimal additional training [1].\n\nThe optimal balance between specialization and generalization depends on the specific application context, including the diversity of tasks, availability of training data, and requirements for peak performance versus flexibility. In practice, many successful deployments may involve a combination of general-purpose foundation models for broad understanding with specialized components for task-specific refinement, creating hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths of both approaches [2].\n\n## 6 Cross-Domain Applications and Case Studies\n\n### 6.1 Environmental Science and Earth Observation\n\nThe application of spatio-temporal foundation models to environmental science and Earth observation represents one of the most promising and impactful domains, with potential applications in climate modeling, ecosystem monitoring, and natural disaster prediction. The OBIA-Mamba architecture for Sentinel-2 landcover mapping demonstrates the capabilities of modern STFMs in processing complex satellite imagery to produce detailed classification maps [1]. This approach addresses key challenges in remote sensing, including spatial heterogeneity, contextual information integration, and signature ambiguity through its global-local architecture and multitask optimization framework.\n\nBeyond landcover classification, STFMs show considerable promise for climate modeling and weather prediction. Traditional numerical weather prediction models rely on complex physical simulations that are computationally intensive and may struggle to capture certain nonlinear processes. Data-driven approaches using foundation models offer complementary capabilities, potentially capturing patterns that are difficult to model explicitly while offering substantially faster inference times. The latent space manipulation techniques exemplified by LUA could be particularly valuable in this domain, enabling efficient downscaling of global climate predictions to regional or local scales [7].\n\nThe integration of diverse data sources represents another significant opportunity for STFMs in environmental science. By combining satellite imagery, ground-based sensor networks, atmospheric measurements, and even social media feeds, foundation models can develop comprehensive understanding of environmental systems that transcends what is possible from any single data source. The querying capabilities demonstrated in scenario program analysis of time series data could be adapted to environmental monitoring, enabling efficient identification of specific patterns or events across massive spatio-temporal datasets [3].\n\n### 6.2 Urban Computing and Intelligent Transportation\n\nUrban environments generate vast amounts of spatio-temporal data from sources including traffic sensors, surveillance cameras, mobility services, and infrastructure monitoring systems, creating rich opportunities for foundation model applications. Traffic prediction represents a canonical problem in this domain, requiring the modeling of complex spatial networks and temporal patterns across multiple scales. Traditional approaches often struggle with long-range dependencies and rare events, limitations that STFMs are particularly well-suited to address through their ability to capture complex patterns across extended spatial and temporal contexts [2].\n\nThe optimization of UAV flight paths for post-disaster reconnaissance demonstrates how spatio-temporal modeling can inform decision-making in critical scenarios [2]. This application requires reasoning about multiple constraints, including sensor coverage, uncertainty minimization, and operational limitations, within highly dynamic and unstructured environments. Foundation models with integrated reasoning capabilities, potentially enhanced through frameworks like SSR, could significantly improve such optimization tasks by considering a broader range of factors and anticipating second-order effects [8].\n\nUrban planning and infrastructure management represent longer-term applications where STFMs could provide valuable insights by modeling the evolution of urban systems over extended time horizons. By learning from historical data across multiple cities, foundation models could identify patterns of urban development, predict the impact of policy interventions, and optimize infrastructure investments. The ability to perform counterfactual reasoning would be particularly valuable in this context, enabling planners to explore the potential outcomes of different decisions before implementation [2].\n\n### 6.3 Healthcare and Epidemiology\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of spatio-temporal modeling in understanding and managing disease spread, with foundation models offering potential enhancements to traditional epidemiological approaches. By integrating diverse data sources including case reports, mobility patterns, environmental factors, and healthcare capacity, STFMs could provide more accurate predictions of disease dynamics and more effective guidance for intervention strategies [12].\n\nThe M&M-3D architecture for cancer detection in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis demonstrates how spatio-temporal reasoning can enhance medical imaging analysis [12]. This approach constructs malignancy-guided 3D features and learns 3D reasoning through repeated mixing of these features with slice-level information, achieving significant improvements over 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods while remaining parameter-free relative to its 2D counterpart. The success of this architecture suggests potential applications in other medical imaging modalities where volumetric reasoning is essential, such as CT and MRI analysis [12].\n\nBeyond medical imaging, STFMs show promise for modeling physiological processes that evolve across both space and time, such as neural activity, cardiac function, and disease progression. The Resonance Principle, which links phase synchronization in neural oscillators to emergent causal understanding, offers a theoretical framework that could inform the development of foundation models for complex biological systems [10]. By capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of physiological processes, such models could enhance diagnosis, treatment planning, and fundamental biological understanding.\n\n### 6.4 Fundamental Science and Discovery\n\nSpatio-temporal foundation models are increasingly being applied to fundamental scientific problems across physics, chemistry, and materials science, where they can help uncover patterns that may be difficult to discern through traditional analysis. In cosmology, for instance, STFMs could enhance the analysis of large-scale structure formation, cosmic microwave background data, and galaxy evolution [13]; [9]. The Synference framework for galaxy SED fitting demonstrates how simulation-based inference can accelerate scientific discovery in astrophysics, and similar approaches could be applied to other domains where physical simulations are available [9].\n\nIn materials science, the unsupervised machine learning framework for analyzing excitonic landscapes in monolayer lateral heterostructures shows how STFMs can extract meaningful patterns from complex experimental data [14]. By combining principal component analysis, t-SNE, and density-based spatial clustering, this approach identifies spectrally distinct domains associated with composition, strain, and defect variations in 2D materials. The automation of such analysis through foundation models could dramatically accelerate materials characterization and discovery [14].\n\nQuantum materials represent another domain where STFMs could provide valuable insights, particularly in understanding the complex interplay of electronic and structural degrees of freedom. The study of polar lattice vibrations in KTaO₃ and SrTiO₃ reveals rich spatio-temporal dynamics that could be captured more comprehensively through foundation models [15]. Similarly, the investigation of novel quantum states like the supernematic phase driven by combinatorial constraints could benefit from data-driven approaches that identify patterns across different parameter regimes and experimental conditions [16].\n\n## 7 Critical Challenges and Future Directions\n\n### 7.1 Data Quality, Heterogeneity, and Integration\n\nThe development of robust spatio-temporal foundation models faces significant challenges related to data quality, heterogeneity, and integration. Real-world spatio-temporal datasets often exhibit complex issues including missing values, systematic biases, varying resolutions, and inconsistent sampling patterns. These challenges are compounded when integrating data from multiple sources, which may use different coordinate systems, temporal references, and measurement protocols [3]. The querying of labeled time series data with scenario programs offers one approach to addressing these challenges, providing formal methods for identifying relevant patterns across heterogeneous datasets [3].\n\nThe problem of non-stationary noise presents particular difficulties for spatio-temporal modeling, as traditional assumptions of stationarity are often violated in real-world systems. The analysis of wavelet domain noise covariance matrices in gravitational wave detection provides insights that could inform more robust approaches to handling non-stationarity in broader spatio-temporal contexts [17]. By understanding the conditions under which noise correlation matrices can be approximated as diagonal, researchers can develop more effective preprocessing and modeling strategies for non-stationary spatio-temporal data.\n\nFuture directions in data handling for STFMs likely involve the development of more sophisticated methods for quality assessment, imputation, and alignment across heterogeneous sources. Self-supervised approaches that learn robust representations despite data imperfections offer particular promise, as do methods that explicitly model uncertainty and confidence in predictions. The integration of physical constraints and domain knowledge could further enhance data handling by providing principled guidance for addressing gaps and inconsistencies [3].\n\n### 7.2 Computational and Infrastructure Requirements\n\nThe computational demands of training and deploying large-scale spatio-temporal foundation models present substantial practical challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption. The ParoQuant quantization method demonstrates one approach to mitigating these demands through efficient weight compression, but additional innovations are needed across the entire model lifecycle from training to inference [6]. The impacts of decoder latency on quantum computer architectures, though focused on a different domain, highlight general principles about the relationship between computational speed and system performance that are relevant to classical computing as well [18].\n\nDistributed training strategies represent another critical area for innovation, particularly as model sizes continue to increase. Efficient parallelization across hundreds or thousands of accelerators requires careful attention to communication patterns, memory usage, and load balancing. The Black-Box On-Policy Distillation approach offers an alternative path to capability development that may reduce training requirements by leveraging existing large models as teachers [11]. This method could be particularly valuable for organizations with limited computational resources, enabling them to develop capable spatio-temporal models without the expense of training from scratch.\n\nThe deployment of STFMs in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices, drones, or mobile sensors presents additional challenges related to memory, power consumption, and inference speed. The SmolVLM2 evaluation on mobile devices demonstrates that even large vision-language models can be adapted for mobile deployment through careful optimization and quantization [5]. Similar approaches could enable the deployment of spatio-temporal foundation capabilities in field applications where cloud connectivity may be limited or latency requirements demand local processing.\n\n### 7.3 Interpretability, Accountability, and Ethical Considerations\n\nAs spatio-temporal foundation models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications such as urban planning, healthcare, and environmental management, ensuring their interpretability and accountability becomes critically important. The black-box nature of many deep learning models poses challenges for understanding how predictions are generated and for identifying potential sources of error or bias. The Socratic Self-Refine framework offers one approach to enhancing interpretability by decomposing reasoning into verifiable steps and enabling pinpoint refinement of unreliable components [8].\n\nThe model-oriented graph distances framework provides a formal foundation for comparing and evaluating graphical models, which could be extended to spatio-temporal representations [19]. By treating graphs as statistical models and organizing them in partially ordered sets based on model inclusion, this approach induces a neighborhood structure that supports meaningful distance metrics. Similar formalisms could enhance our understanding of how different spatio-temporal representations capture underlying processes and support more systematic model evaluation and selection.\n\nEthical considerations in spatio-temporal modeling include concerns about privacy, fairness, and potential misuse. Models that predict individual mobility patterns or property values could reveal sensitive information or perpetuate existing biases if not carefully designed and validated. The development of ethical frameworks and technical safeguards for spatio-temporal foundation models represents an important direction for future research, requiring collaboration across computer science, social sciences, and domain experts [2].\n\n### 7.4 Integration with Physical Principles and Causal Reasoning\n\nA fundamental limitation of many current data-driven approaches to spatio-temporal prediction is their reliance on correlation rather than causation, which can lead to unreliable predictions when conditions change or interventions are applied. Integrating physical principles and causal reasoning capabilities represents a crucial direction for advancing the field beyond pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of spatio-temporal dynamics [10].\n\nThe Resonance Principle proposes that causal understanding emerges in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions, modeled as networks of weakly coupled oscillators [10]. This theoretical framework, supported by empirical evidence from neural data, suggests directions for designing STFMs that can reason about interventions and counterfactuals rather than merely extrapolating patterns. By incorporating similar principles, future foundation models could develop more robust understanding of spatio-temporal systems that generalizes better to novel scenarios.\n\nThe unitary architecture of renormalization in quantum field theory offers another perspective on how fundamental physical principles could inform model design [20]. The bootstrap problem for renormalization, with its recursion relations between scattering amplitudes of different multiplicities, reveals deep connections between unitarity and renormalization that could inspire new architectural elements for STFMs. While the direct application of quantum field theory concepts to machine learning remains speculative, the mathematical structures involved may offer valuable insights for capturing multi-scale phenomena in spatio-temporal systems.\n\nThe integration of explicit physical constraints represents a more immediate approach to grounding STFMs in fundamental principles. By incorporating conservation laws, symmetry properties, or known physical relationships directly into model architectures or training procedures",

      "abstract": "Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.",

In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.",

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime.

      "abstract": "Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.",

To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.",

While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.",

      "abstract": "Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales (k > 1 h/Mpc) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.",

      "abstract": "The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.",

We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $Λ$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\\ln B = -0.57{\\scriptstyle\\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$σ$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\\scriptstyle\\pm0.10}\\,σ$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\\approx 2.95σ$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $Λ$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.",

We study the mixing time of this Markov chain for fixed $m$, $d$, and $μ$, as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. We show that there is cutoff whenever the chain on $[d]$ corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, and that the same holds for a labeled version of the model. As an application, we also obtain partial results on cutoff for a card shuffling version of the model in which the cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters.",

We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.",

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.",

While there are typically standard distances to adopt in a continuous space, this is not the case for combinatorial parameters such as graphs that represent statistical models. Existing proposals like the structural Hamming distance are defined on the graphs rather than the models they represent and can hence lead to undesirable behaviors. We propose a model-oriented framework for defining the distance between graphs that is applicable across many different graph classes. Our approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes the graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion. This induces a neighborhood structure, from which we define the model-oriented distance as the length of a shortest path through neighbors, yielding a metric in the space of graphs. We apply this framework to both probabilistic graphical models (e.g., undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs) and causal graphical models (e.g., directed acyclic graphs and maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs). We analyze the theoretical and empirical behaviors of model-oriented distances. Algorithmic tools are also developed for computing and bounding these distances.",

Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons.",

By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains. Empirical results across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs show that SSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines. Beyond performance gains, SSR provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/socratic-self-refine-reasoning.",

      "abstract": "The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.",

The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.",

Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders.

Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.",

Exotic forms of fermion pairing and superfluidity are predicted when attraction between fermions competes with spin doping. Here, we follow the evolution of fermion pairing and charge and spin order in a spin-imbalanced attractive Hubbard gas of fermionic $^{40}$K atoms, covering a wide range of densities, magnetizations, and interactions with single-atom resolution. At low spin imbalance and weak interactions, we find a mixture of nonlocal fermion pairs coexisting with itinerant excess fermions. For stronger interactions an effective hard-core Bose-Fermi mixture emerges. Spin doping drives a crossover from charge-density wave correlations to a Fermi liquid of polarons. Beyond a certain spin imbalance and interaction strength, we find evidence for the onset of combined spin- and pair-density wave order, a possible precursor for the existence of magnetized superfluidity in the attractive Hubbard system.",

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.",

This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance.

      "abstract": "Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.",

We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.",

The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language.

The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision.

There has been great interest in leveraging biomolecular foundation models as surrogates to accelerate this process. In this work, we show how to obtain scalable probabilistic surrogates of binding affinity for use in Batch Bayesian Optimization (Batch BO). This demands parallel acquisition functions that hedge between designs and the ability to rapidly sample from a joint predictive density to approximate them. Through the framework of Epistemic Neural Networks (ENNs), we obtain scalable joint predictive distributions of binding affinity on top of representations taken from large structure-informed models. Key to this work is an investigation into the importance of prior networks in ENNs and how to pretrain them on synthetic data to improve downstream performance in Batch BO. Their utility is demonstrated by rediscovering known potent EGFR inhibitors on a semi-synthetic benchmark in up to 5x fewer iterations, as well as potent inhibitors from a real-world small-molecule library in up to 10x fewer iterations, offering a promising solution for large-scale drug discovery applications.",
