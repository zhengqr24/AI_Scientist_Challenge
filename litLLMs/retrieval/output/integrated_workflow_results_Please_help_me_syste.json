  "review": "# The Evolution of World Models: A Systematic Mapping from Cognitive Foundations to Artificial Intelligence Systems\n\n## 1 Introduction: The Conceptual Bedrock of World Models\n\n### 1.1 Defining the \"World Model\"\n\nA world model represents an internal representation system, whether instantiated in biological neural networks or artificial computational architectures, that captures the fundamental structure, dynamics, and statistical regularities of an external environment. This conceptual framework enables prediction, reasoning, and strategic planning by simulating potential futures without requiring direct environmental interaction. The core function of any world model centers on uncertainty reduction and free energy minimization through accurate prediction of action consequences and state evolution [1]. This predictive capacity forms the foundation for intelligent behavior across both biological and artificial systems, serving as the computational substrate that bridges perception to action through internal simulation.\n\nThe theoretical underpinnings of world models extend beyond mere pattern recognition to encompass genuine causal understanding of environmental dynamics. As articulated in the Resonance Principle, causal comprehension emerges specifically from predictive, resonant dynamics within stochastic systems [1]. This perspective challenges deterministic digital architectures and suggests that genuine world modeling requires systems capable of emergent phase synchronization—a property observed in biological neural networks but largely absent in contemporary artificial intelligence systems. The distinction between correlational pattern matching and true causal understanding represents a fundamental divide in world model capabilities, with significant implications for artificial intelligence development.\n\n### 1.2 The Centrality of Prediction\n\nPrediction serves as the primary mechanism through which world models generate value, enabling systems to anticipate future states and select actions that maximize desirable outcomes while minimizing potential risks. This predictive function manifests across multiple domains and scales, from low-level motor control to high-level strategic reasoning. In reinforcement learning contexts, world models function as internal simulators that allow agents to mentally trial actions before execution, dramatically improving sample efficiency and enabling more sophisticated planning [2]. The predictive capacity also underlies more efficient compression, as demonstrated by encoder-augmented causal decoder architectures that approach the information-theoretic limits of language modeling [3].\n\nThe mathematical formalization of prediction within world models connects to fundamental information theory principles. As established in entropy estimation research, language prediction faces inherent constraints from informational entropy intrinsic to language itself, establishing theoretical limits to model accuracy and compression efficiency [3]. This relationship between prediction quality and computational efficiency underscores why world modeling represents such a crucial capability—systems that can accurately predict their environments necessarily develop more compact, generalizable representations that transfer effectively across related domains and tasks.\n\n### 1.3 Scope and Narrative of the Review\n\nThis review systematically maps the historical development and conceptual evolution of world models across multiple disciplines, analyzing forty representative papers that mark significant waypoints in this intellectual journey. Our trajectory begins with cognitive and neuroscientific origins, progresses through classical artificial intelligence and robotics formalizations, examines the transformative impact of deep learning, and explores specialized instantiations in physical modeling, reasoning systems, and diverse scientific domains. Each section provides detailed analysis of how influential papers approach the core challenge of world modeling, with particular attention to methodological innovations, theoretical contributions, and practical implementations.\n\nThe narrative arc reveals a consistent progression from explicit, hand-engineered representations toward learned, implicit models that extract environmental regularities directly from data. This transition mirrors broader trends in artificial intelligence from symbolic manipulation to statistical learning, while also highlighting enduring challenges in areas like causal reasoning, compositional understanding, and sample-efficient learning. By examining these developments systematically, we identify both the converging principles that unite diverse approaches to world modeling and the distinctive contributions that different disciplines bring to this fundamentally interdisciplinary problem space.\n\n## 2 Cognitive and Neuroscientific Origins\n\n### 2.1 The Helmholtzian Notion of Unconscious Inference\n\nThe conceptual foundations of world models trace back to 19th-century perceptual theories, particularly Hermann von Helmholtz's pioneering work on unconscious inference. Helmholtz proposed that perception operates not as passive reception of sensory data but as an active process of hypothesis testing against internal models of the world. This revolutionary perspective positioned the brain as constructing perceptual experience through Bayesian-like inference, where sensory inputs serve as evidence for evaluating internally-generated predictions about environmental states. The Helmholtzian framework established the core principle that organisms navigate their environments not through direct access to external reality but through constantly updated internal representations that probabilistically model causal structures.\n\nThis perceptual theory implicitly contained the essential components of modern world models: generative processes that produce predictions, comparison mechanisms that evaluate prediction errors, and updating procedures that refine internal representations based on mismatches between expected and observed outcomes. The mathematical formalization of these concepts would await 20th-century developments in information theory and Bayesian statistics, but the core insight—that perception and cognition rely on predictive modeling—established the foundational paradigm for understanding how biological systems interact with their environments. This perspective fundamentally reshaped understanding of brain function, positioning neural computation as primarily concerned with maintaining accurate predictive models rather than merely processing incoming sensory data.\n\n### 2.2 The Computational Theory of Mind\n\nThe mid-20th century witnessed the emergence of the computational theory of mind, which provided the conceptual framework for formalizing world models as information-processing systems. Cognitive scientists like David Marr articulated hierarchical levels of analysis—computational, algorithmic, and implementational—that enabled systematic study of how brains might construct and utilize internal models. This computational perspective enabled researchers to abstract away from biological implementation details and focus on the fundamental information-processing challenges that any intelligent system must solve when building representations of its environment.\n\nWithin this computational framework, world models emerged as the central machinery enabling organisms to transcend stimulus-response patterns and exhibit flexible, goal-directed behavior. The key insight was that internal models allow systems to simulate outcomes without actual execution, dramatically expanding behavioral repertoire while minimizing costly trial-and-error learning. This simulation capacity proved particularly valuable for planning and reasoning in complex environments where actions have delayed consequences and multiple potential outcomes. The computational perspective also highlighted the tradeoffs between model complexity, accuracy, and computational tractability—considerations that would later become central to artificial intelligence approaches to world modeling.\n\n### 2.3 Predictive Processing and the Free Energy Principle\n\nContemporary neuroscience has formalized these ideas through predictive processing frameworks and the free energy principle, which present the brain as a hierarchical prediction engine constantly updating its world model to minimize surprise. Karl Friston's free energy principle provides a unified account of perception, learning, and action under the single imperative of minimizing variational free energy—a mathematical bound on surprise. This framework positions world models as the central mechanism through which biological systems maintain their structural and functional integrity despite environmental uncertainty and change.\n\nThe Resonance Principle offers compelling empirical support for this theoretical framework, demonstrating through EEG analysis that causal understanding emerges from stochastic, resonant dynamics in neural systems [1]. The study analyzed high-density EEG data from P300 BCI tasks, computing the Kuramoto Order Parameter to measure global phase synchronization as an indicator of resonance. The findings revealed that while global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), trial-level analysis demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001), suggesting resonance serves as a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing to produce measurable event-related potentials. This empirical evidence supports the theoretical claim that phase synchronization constitutes a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding rather than merely a byproduct of neural activity.\n\nThe contrast between these neuroscientific findings and current artificial intelligence approaches highlights a significant gap in contemporary world modeling research. Biological systems appear to leverage stochastic, resonant dynamics for genuine causal understanding, while most artificial systems rely on deterministic architectures optimized for correlational pattern matching. This distinction may explain why current AI systems excel at tasks requiring statistical regularity but struggle with genuine causal reasoning and understanding. The Resonance Principle suggests that incorporating similar stochastic, resonant properties might enable artificial systems to overcome these limitations and develop more robust world models capable of true causal reasoning.\n\n## 3 Classical AI and Robotics: The First Formalizations\n\n### 3.1 Symbolic AI and Mental Models\n\nEarly artificial intelligence research approached world modeling through symbolic representations, where world knowledge was explicitly encoded in structured knowledge bases using formal logics and production systems. Systems like SOAR and ACT-R implemented comprehensive cognitive architectures that separated procedural and declarative knowledge while maintaining explicit world models that could be manipulated through symbolic reasoning. These architectures enabled sophisticated problem-solving and planning capabilities by representing world states as collections of symbolic propositions and actions as operators that transformed these symbolic states according to predefined rules.\n\nThe symbolic approach excelled in domains where comprehensive domain knowledge could be formally specified, such as mathematical theorem proving and constrained puzzle-solving environments. However, this methodology faced fundamental limitations when applied to complex, real-world domains characterized by uncertainty, partial observability, and combinatorial state spaces. The knowledge acquisition bottleneck—the difficulty of manually encoding comprehensive world knowledge—proved particularly challenging, as did the frame problem—determining which aspects of a world state change following an action. These limitations motivated the development of alternative approaches that could acquire world models directly from experience rather than relying on hand-engineered symbolic representations.\n\n### 3.2 The Rise of Probabilistic Models\n\nThe recognition of these limitations spurred a shift toward probabilistic frameworks that explicitly represented and reasoned about uncertainty. Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provided mathematical formalisms for treating world states as latent variables to be inferred from partial, noisy observations. These probabilistic approaches enabled more robust reasoning under uncertainty while maintaining interpretable, structured representations of environmental dynamics and dependencies.\n\nThe model-oriented graph distances framework provides a modern lens for evaluating these classical model structures, offering systematic methods for defining distances between graphical models based on their representational power rather than superficial structural differences [4]. This approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion, inducing a neighborhood structure that enables meaningful distance metrics in graph space. By applying this framework to probabilistic graphical models like undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs, researchers can quantitatively compare different world modeling approaches and understand their relative expressive capabilities and limitations.\n\nProbabilistic approaches significantly advanced world modeling capabilities, particularly in domains characterized by uncertainty and partial observability. However, they still faced scalability challenges in high-dimensional, continuous domains common in real-world applications. The curse of dimensionality limited their applicability to complex sensory domains, while the need for manual specification of model structure maintained elements of the knowledge engineering bottleneck that had plagued purely symbolic approaches. These limitations would eventually motivate the transition to learned representations that could automatically extract relevant structure from high-dimensional sensory data.\n\n### 3.3 Embodied Cognition and Behavior-Based Robotics\n\nA significant counterpoint to complex internal modeling emerged from embodied cognition and behavior-based robotics, most notably in Rodney Brooks' influential critique \"Intelligence Without Representation.\" Brooks argued that explicit world models were often unnecessary for competent real-world behavior, proposing instead that \"the world is its own best model.\" This perspective emphasized direct perception-action coupling through layered behavioral modules that operated without comprehensive internal representations. The subsumption architecture exemplified this approach, creating robust robotic behaviors through simple, reactive components rather than detailed internal models.\n\nThis embodied perspective highlighted situations where elaborate world modeling might be computationally wasteful or practically infeasible, particularly in dynamically changing environments where maintaining accurate models requires constant updating. Behavior-based systems demonstrated remarkable robustness and adaptability in many real-world scenarios, outperforming more computationally sophisticated approaches that relied on detailed internal representations. However, these reactive architectures faced limitations in domains requiring long-term planning, reasoning about unobservable states, or learning from limited experience—capabilities that ultimately require some form of internal modeling.\n\nThe tension between model-based and model-free approaches continues to influence contemporary world modeling research, with recent work often seeking hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both perspectives. The key insight emerging from this historical debate is that the appropriate complexity of world models depends critically on environmental structure, task requirements, and computational constraints—there exists no universally optimal approach across all domains and applications.\n\n## 4 The Deep Learning Revolution: Learning Models from Data\n\n### 4.1 From Hand-Engineering to End-to-End Learning\n\nThe deep learning revolution transformed world modeling from a primarily hand-engineering endeavor to a data-driven learning process. This paradigm shift enabled systems to acquire high-dimensional, latent representations directly from sensory inputs using deep neural networks, bypassing the need for manual feature engineering and explicit model specification. The key innovation was the development of architectures capable of automatically discovering relevant features and structures from raw data, allowing world models to scale to complex, high-dimensional domains that had previously been intractable for classical approaches.\n\nThis transition from programmed to learned representations dramatically expanded the scope of world modeling applications, enabling progress in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and other domains where manual model specification was impractical. The end-to-end learning paradigm allowed systems to discover task-relevant representations directly from data, often revealing structures and features that human designers might not have identified. This data-driven approach also improved robustness to noise and variation, as learned models could capture the statistical regularities of real-world data more comprehensively than hand-designed representations.\n\nHowever, this shift also introduced new challenges, particularly regarding interpretability, reliability, and sample efficiency. Learned world models often function as black boxes, making it difficult to understand their internal reasoning processes or identify failure modes. Additionally, the data requirements for training these models could be substantial, particularly in complex domains with rich dynamics. These challenges have motivated ongoing research into more sample-efficient learning methods, interpretability techniques, and approaches for incorporating prior knowledge into learned representations.\n\n### 4.2 Generative Models as World Simulators\n\nGenerative architectures—including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, and diffusion models—emerged as fundamental engines for world modeling due to their ability to learn the underlying data distribution p(x), which implicitly captures the rules and regularities of the environment. By modeling the joint distribution over observations, these architectures can generate coherent samples from the learned distribution, effectively simulating possible world states. This generative capacity provides a powerful foundation for prediction, planning, and reasoning, as systems can mentally simulate trajectories without direct environmental interaction.\n\nThe Latent Upscaler Adapter exemplifies how generative world models can be scaled and refined to produce more detailed and coherent predictions [5]. This approach performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final decoding step, integrating as a lightweight drop-in component that requires no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages. By operating in latent space rather than pixel space, LUA achieves nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time while maintaining comparable perceptual quality, adding only +0.42 seconds for 1024 px generation from 512 px compared to 1.87 seconds for pixel-space super-resolution using the same architecture. This demonstrates how efficient refinement of generative world models can enable scalable, high-fidelity simulation while minimizing computational overhead.\n\nGenerative world models have proven particularly valuable in model-based reinforcement learning, where they enable agents to learn complex behaviors with significantly improved sample efficiency. By training on historical interaction data, these models can predict future states and rewards, allowing agents to evaluate potential action sequences through mental simulation rather than costly environmental interaction. This approach has enabled progress in domains ranging from video game playing to robotic manipulation, demonstrating the practical value of learned generative models for decision-making in complex environments.\n\n### 4.3 The Explicit World Model Paper: A Case Study in RL\n\nThe 2018 \"World Models\" paper by Ha and Schmidhuber provided a seminal architecture that explicitly separated world modeling into three distinct components: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for perceptual compression, a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDN-RNN) for dynamics prediction, and a simple controller for action selection. This modular decomposition established a clear blueprint for separating perception, dynamics modeling, and control, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization. The V component compresses high-dimensional sensory inputs into compact latent representations, the M component learns to predict future latent states given current states and actions, and the C component learns successful behaviors using the internal model as a simulation environment.\n\nThis architecture demonstrated that agents could learn complex behaviors entirely within learned world models, developing sophisticated strategies without direct environmental interaction once the model was sufficiently accurate. The approach achieved remarkable performance in challenging environments like car racing and maze navigation, often surpassing human-level performance while requiring orders of magnitude fewer environmental interactions than model-free approaches. The success of this explicit world modeling framework inspired numerous subsequent developments in model-based reinforcement learning and established a reference point for evaluating alternative approaches to learned world models.\n\nThe explicit decomposition also facilitated analysis of which components contributed most to performance and where failures occurred, providing valuable insights for improving world modeling architectures. Subsequent research has explored variations on this theme, including different representation learning methods, alternative dynamics models, and improved planning algorithms. The core insight—that separating perception, prediction, and control can improve learning efficiency and generalization—continues to influence contemporary world modeling research across diverse domains.\n\n## 5 World Models for Physical and Geometric Understanding\n\n### 5.1 Modeling 3D Geometry and Depth\n\nPhysical world modeling requires explicit representation of 3D structure and geometry to enable accurate interaction with the environment. Depth Anything 3 exemplifies modern approaches to geometric world modeling, using a plain transformer backbone to achieve spatially consistent geometry prediction from arbitrary views without architectural specialization [6]. This \"minimal modeling\" philosophy demonstrates that sophisticated geometric understanding can emerge from appropriately structured learning objectives rather than complex, hand-engineered architectures. The teacher-student training paradigm enables the model to achieve detail and generalization comparable to specialized architectures while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThe approach yields two key insights for geometric world modeling: first, that a single plain transformer is sufficient as a backbone without specialized geometric inductive biases, and second, that a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. By establishing a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry, and visual rendering, Depth Anything 3 sets new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. These advances demonstrate how learned geometric world models can achieve robust 3D understanding from visual inputs, enabling more capable robotic systems and augmented reality applications.\n\nGeometric world models face unique challenges compared to other domains, particularly regarding the integration of different sensing modalities, handling of occlusion and partial observability, and maintaining consistency across viewpoints. Approaches that learn geometric representations directly from data have demonstrated advantages in handling these challenges compared to traditional geometric modeling techniques, particularly in unstructured environments where assumptions of regularity may not hold. The success of methods like Depth Anything 3 suggests that learned geometric representations may play an increasingly important role in applications requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.\n\n### 5.2 World Models in Physics and Cosmology\n\nThe world modeling concept extends beyond artificial intelligence to scientific domains where researchers build computational models of physical systems. In cosmology, analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra represent a form of world modeling that isolates the universal imprints of spatial curvature on the early universe [7]. These analytical templates, derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, capture how curvature modifies underlying dynamics through systematic shifts in dynamically relevant wavevectors. The resulting predictions include characteristic large-scale features—low-ℓ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns—that provide potential discriminants for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations, particularly in large-angle B-mode polarization spectra.\n\nSimilarly, research on baryonic feedback across halo mass uses cosmological simulations like IllustrisTNG as ground-truth world models to understand how baryonic processes modify the matter distribution [8]. This work quantifies how group-scale halos with log M₂₀₀m/h⁻¹ M☉ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression of the matter power spectrum, contributing most of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. Crucially, correctly reproducing the full suppression requires accounting for matter redistribution beyond the virial radius of each halo while enforcing mass conservation. These findings motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales where baryonic physics significantly modifies clustering.\n\nThese scientific applications demonstrate how world modeling principles apply beyond artificial intelligence to fundamental scientific inquiry. In both cases, researchers build computational models that capture essential aspects of physical systems, enabling prediction and reasoning about phenomena that cannot be directly manipulated or observed. The methodological parallels between scientific modeling and artificial intelligence world modeling highlight the fundamental unity of the representational challenge across domains—identifying compact descriptions that capture the essential dynamics of complex systems.\n\n### 5.3 Probing Material Topology\n\nWorld modeling concepts also appear in condensed matter physics, where researchers study how material properties emerge from microscopic structure. Research on ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology demonstrates how ubiquitous defects—vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs—can serve as universal probes of non-trivial topology in electronic Bloch bands [9]. Though these ordinary defects are topologically trivial themselves, they can reveal changes in the local topological environment through mid-gap bound states in their vicinity, as established through minimal model Hamiltonians describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice.\n\nThis approach showcases how world modeling operates at multiple scales: at the microscopic level, electronic structure forms a \"world model\" that determines material properties, while at the experimental level, researchers build models to understand how perturbations reveal underlying structure. The experimental validation using two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy reconstructs spectra and eigenstates, demonstrates the practical utility of this modeling approach. The findings raise the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near ordinary defects in topological superconductors, suggesting potential applications in topological quantum computing.\n\nThe cross-fertilization between world modeling in artificial intelligence and scientific domains illustrates how representational principles transcend disciplinary boundaries. In each case, the fundamental challenge involves building compact, predictive models of complex systems that enable reasoning, prediction, and intervention. The methodological exchanges between these domains—with AI borrowing mathematical formalisms from physics and physics adopting computational approaches from AI—highlight the productive interdisciplinary nature of world modeling research.\n\n## 6 World Models for Sequential Decision-Making and Control\n\n### 6.1 Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)\n\nModel-Based Reinforcement Learning represents the field most directly concerned with learning and using world models—specifically dynamics models—for planning and policy improvement. Unlike model-free approaches that learn policies directly from experience, MBRL methods learn explicit models of environment dynamics, which they then use for mental simulation and planning. This approach typically offers significantly improved sample efficiency, as agents can learn from imagined trajectories rather than requiring extensive environmental interaction. However, MBRL introduces additional complexity, including the challenge of model bias—where inaccurate models can lead to poor policies—and the computational cost of planning using learned models.\n\nThe core innovation in modern MBRL involves learning accurate dynamics models from high-dimensional sensory inputs, which requires combining representation learning with dynamics prediction. Approaches like the explicit world model architecture demonstrate how this can be achieved through modular systems that separate perception, prediction, and control. Subsequent research has explored more integrated approaches, alternative model architectures, and improved planning algorithms that work effectively with learned models. These developments have enabled MBRL to scale to increasingly complex domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and complex strategy games.\n\nA key challenge in MBRL involves balancing exploitation of the current model with exploration to improve model accuracy, particularly in regions where the model is uncertain. Various approaches address this challenge, including uncertainty-aware modeling, targeted exploration strategies, and methods that explicitly account for model error during planning. The successful application of MBRL to real-world problems requires careful attention to these issues, as model inaccuracies can lead to catastrophic failures in safety-critical applications.\n\n### 6.2 The Outcome-Reward Problem and its Solution\n\nA fundamental challenge in outcome-reward reinforcement learning for multimodal large language models involves the problem of unfaithful reasoning—trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning [2]. Self-Consistency Sampling addresses this issue by introducing visual perturbations and performing repeated truncation and resampling of initial trajectories; agreement among resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates [2]. This approach improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.\n\nThe methodological innovation in SCS lies in its use of consistency across multiple reasoning paths as a proxy for reasoning quality, effectively creating a more truthful reward signal that penalizes lucky guesses following flawed reasoning. This approach connects to broader principles in world modeling, particularly the idea that robust reasoning requires consistency across multiple perspectives or perturbations. By evaluating reasoning quality through agreement across slightly varied conditions, SCS provides a practical method for refining the internal reasoning processes of large models without requiring explicit supervision of reasoning steps.\n\nThe success of SCS highlights how world modeling principles can address specific challenges in training complex AI systems. The approach demonstrates that carefully designed training signals that leverage consistency and robustness can guide models toward more reliable reasoning patterns, even in the absence of direct supervision of internal processes. This methodology represents a promising direction for improving the reasoning capabilities of large models while maintaining the efficiency of outcome-based reward signals.\n\n### 6.3 Learning Complex Motor Skills\n\nWorld modeling plays a crucial role in learning complex motor skills, particularly in domains like robotics where trial-and-error learning in the real world can be costly or dangerous. The Robot Crash Course approach tackles the unique aspect of modeling falling dynamics, with the goal of reducing physical damage while providing control over a robot's end pose [10]. The method proposes a robot-agnostic reward function that balances achieving a desired end pose with impact minimization and protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To enable robustness to broad falling conditions and arbitrary unseen end poses at inference time, the approach uses simulation-based sampling of initial and end poses.\n\nThis application demonstrates how specialized world models can address specific challenges in physical interaction. By focusing specifically on falling dynamics—a scenario that most robotics research seeks to avoid—the approach develops targeted modeling capabilities that enhance safety and reliability. The success in both simulated and real-world experiments shows that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls, highlighting how targeted world modeling can expand the capabilities of robotic systems in challenging scenarios.\n\nThe methodology also illustrates the value of simulation-based training for developing physical world models. By leveraging simulated environments, the approach can explore a wide range of scenarios that would be impractical or dangerous to encounter in real-world training. This use of simulation as a structured data source for world model learning represents a powerful paradigm for developing robust physical interaction capabilities while minimizing real-world risks.\n\n### 6.4 Optimization with Hidden Convexity\n\nMany control and reinforcement learning problems possess hidden convexity, meaning that while they appear non-convex in their original parameterization, they can be reformulated as convex programs via nonlinear invertible transformations [11]. This mathematical property has significant implications for world modeling, as it suggests that many apparently complex learning problems have underlying structure that enables global convergence guarantees. Research on global solutions to non-convex functional constrained problems develops algorithms that provably solve such problems to global minima despite their non-convex appearance, achieving oracle complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.\n\nThe practical significance of hidden convexity lies in its assurance that local optimization methods can find globally optimal solutions for certain classes of problems, provided the optimization is conducted appropriately. For world modeling, this means that learned models and policies may be more amenable to reliable optimization than their surface complexity suggests. The development of algorithms that leverage this structure without requiring explicit knowledge of the convexifying transformation represents an important advance for practical applications where such transformations may be implicit or unknown.\n\nThe connection between hidden convexity and world modeling highlights the importance of understanding the mathematical structure of learning problems. By recognizing that many challenging optimization problems in control and reinforcement learning possess favorable underlying structure, researchers can develop more effective learning algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees. This mathematical perspective complements empirical approaches to world modeling, providing foundations for understanding when and why certain methods succeed.\n\n## 7 World Models in Language, Reasoning, and Knowledge\n\n### 7.1 Large Language Models as Conceptual World Models\n\nLarge Language Models function as immense, implicit world models trained on human knowledge and language, capable of predicting text and simulating conversations, narratives, and reasoning chains. Unlike specialized world models designed for specific domains, LLMs capture broad conceptual knowledge spanning countless topics and domains. This comprehensive coverage comes at the cost of precision—while LLMs excel at capturing statistical regularities of language and common-sense knowledge, they often struggle with precise reasoning, factual accuracy, and consistency.\n\nThe Instella family of fully open language models demonstrates how world modeling principles apply to language modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results among fully open models despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries [12]. The development of specialized variants—Instella-Long for handling context lengths up to 128K tokens and Instella-Math for reasoning-focused tasks enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning—illustrates how general world models can be adapted for specific capabilities. These developments advance the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research while providing transparent, performant alternatives to closed models.\n\nThe conceptual world models embodied in LLMs raise fascinating questions about the nature of representation and understanding. While these models clearly capture sophisticated patterns in human knowledge, debate continues about whether they genuinely understand the concepts they manipulate or merely exhibit sophisticated pattern matching. This philosophical question connects to practical concerns about reliability, interpretability, and reasoning capabilities, motivating research into methods for enhancing and evaluating the conceptual world models within large language models.\n\n### 7.2 Enhancing Reasoning and Self-Correction\n\nSocratic Self-Refine presents a framework for improving an LLM's internal reasoning world model through fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement [13]. The approach decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs.\n\nThe methodological innovation in SSR lies in its decomposition of reasoning into verifiable components, enabling targeted refinement of specific weak points rather than global resampling. This approach mirrors how human reasoners might identify flawed steps in an argument and focus correction efforts accordingly. The framework provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs without requiring access to internal model states or gradients.\n\nContrasting SSR with the black-box distillation of Generative Adversarial Distillation highlights different approaches to improving reasoning capabilities [14]. While SSR focuses on iterative self-refinement through decomposition and verification, GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game where the discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model. Both approaches demonstrate how world modeling principles can be applied to improve reasoning capabilities, albeit through different mechanisms—internal refinement versus adversarial distillation.\n\n### 7.3 The Information-Theoretic Limits of Language Models\n\nKnow Your Limits connects world model fidelity to fundamental information-theoretic constraints, arguing that language entropy sets a lower bound on model accuracy and compression [3]. The research introduces encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. By demonstrating how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, the work shows that models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.\n\nThis information-theoretic perspective provides important grounding for world modeling efforts, establishing fundamental limits on what can be achieved through improved architectures or training techniques. The connection between compression and generalization offers a theoretical explanation for why models that approach the entropy of their training data generalize better—they necessarily capture the essential regularities while ignoring spurious correlations. This principle applies beyond language modeling to world modeling more broadly, suggesting that optimal models should capture the true entropy of their domains rather than overfitting to training data.\n\nThe practical implication is that entropy estimation provides a valuable guide for model development and training. By monitoring how closely a model approaches the estimated entropy of its domain, researchers can gauge whether further improvements are likely to yield benefits or whether the model is approaching fundamental limits. This perspective helps contextualize progress in world modeling, distinguishing between improvements that genuinely advance capabilities versus those that merely optimize within existing constraints.\n\n## 8 World Models in Scientific Discovery and Specialized Domains\n\n### 8.1 Cosmological Modeling and Dark Energy\n\nWorld modeling principles find sophisticated application in cosmology, where researchers build computational models of the universe's large-scale structure and evolution. A Bayesian perspective on evidence for evolving dark energy demonstrates how model comparison techniques can evaluate competing cosmological models, revealing how preferences for dynamic dark energy models may primarily reflect their ability to resolve specific dataset tensions rather than genuine evidence for new physics [15]. The analysis shows that for the key combination of DESI DR2 BAO and Planck CMB data, Bayesian evidence modestly favors ΛCDM over dynamic dark energy models, contrary to frequentist significance measures.\n\nThis cosmological application illustrates how world modeling operates at the most fundamental scales, with researchers building increasingly sophisticated models of the universe's composition and evolution. The tension between different cosmological datasets highlights challenges familiar from other world modeling domains—how to reconcile conflicting evidence, how to balance model complexity with explanatory power, and how to distinguish genuine discoveries from artifacts of particular modeling assumptions. The comprehensive tension analysis employing five complementary metrics provides a methodology for identifying the specific sources of disagreement between datasets.\n\nAlternative approaches to cosmological modeling include holographic dark matter, which proposes that dark matter arises not from particle physics but from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale [16]. Using the Ricci cutoff in a universe containing only baryons and radiation, this approach can account for dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to density. This theoretical framework demonstrates how radically different world models can account for the same observational data, highlighting the role of theoretical priors in scientific world modeling.\n\n### 8.2 Quantum Computing and Information Processing\n\nWorld modeling concepts extend to quantum computing, where researchers develop quantum algorithms for computing fundamental information-theoretic quantities. Quantum algorithms for computing maximal quantum f-divergence and Kubo-Ando means provide unified frameworks for estimating Renyi entropy, Von Neumann entropy, and matrix means [17]. These developments represent the natural extension of world modeling principles to quantum information processing, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, quantum error correction, and quantum-enhanced simulation.\n\nThe impacts of decoder latency on utility-scale quantum computer architectures highlight how classical computing constraints influence quantum world modeling capabilities [18]. The reaction time of classical electronics—the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine logical measurement outcomes and execute subsequent conditional operations—fundamentally limits quantum computer speed. For surface code-based architectures operating at 2.86 MHz stabilization frequencies, even sub-microsecond decoding speeds introduce substantial resource overheads, including approximately 100k-250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage and 300k-1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor.\n\nThese quantum computing applications demonstrate how world modeling operates across multiple levels of abstraction—from the quantum physical implementation through error correction to algorithmic applications. Each level presents distinct modeling challenges, with constraints at lower levels propagating to influence capabilities at higher levels. The integrated analysis of full-system quantum and classical resources provides a comprehensive perspective on the practical challenges of building large-scale quantum computers capable of implementing sophisticated quantum world models.\n\n### 8.3 Materials Science and Condensed Matter Physics\n\nWorld modeling enables significant advances in materials science, where researchers seek to understand how microscopic structure determines macroscopic properties. Research on uniaxial strain tuning of polar lattice vibrations in KTaO₃ and SrTiO₃ combines inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across strain-induced ferroelectric transitions [19]. The findings reveal strong violations of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating materials, pointing to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions not captured by ab initio calculations.\n\nIn metallic STO, the research uncovers a first-order transition at remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. These results resolve long-standing questions about these model systems while providing methodology relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons. The integration of experimental techniques with computational modeling exemplifies how world modeling operates in materials science, with researchers building increasingly sophisticated models that connect microscopic structure to macroscopic properties.\n\nSupernematic research demonstrates how geometric frustration in quantum systems can enforce global conserved quantities via non-perturbative tiling invariants, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to macroscopically phase-coherent states [20]. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number—the sublattice polarization Ñ = N_A - N_B. Quantum fluctuation drives spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic phase, establishing a route to novel quantum many-body states driven by combinatorial constraints.\n\n## 9 Methodological Advances and Theoretical Foundations\n\n### 9.1 Algorithmic Foundations and Guarantees\n\nStrong theoretical foundations are essential for reliable world modeling, particularly in safety-critical applications. Research on the improving multi-armed bandits problem develops algorithms with stronger guarantees for allocating effort under uncertainty in scenarios like investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves [21]. The work proposes two parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bounds the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data, achieving stronger data-dependent guarantees without needing to verify whether assumptions are satisfied.\n\nThis research addresses fundamental challenges in sequential decision-making, where agents must balance exploration of uncertain options with exploitation of known good options. The improving bandits setting—where reward increases monotonically with diminishing returns—captures many real-world learning scenarios where repeated effort yields improving but eventually plateauing performance. The development of algorithms with improved worst-case guarantees while maintaining strong performance on well-behaved instances represents significant progress for applications requiring reliable decision-making under uncertainty.\n\nThe statistical learning perspective taken in this work—treating bandit reward optimization as a learning problem over algorithm families—provides a framework for developing robust decision-making strategies that adapt to problem characteristics. This approach demonstrates how world modeling principles can be applied to the meta-problem of algorithm selection and configuration, enabling more automated and reliable deployment of decision-making systems across diverse domains.\n\n### 9.2 Mathematical Foundations and Analysis\n\nRigorous mathematical analysis provides essential foundations for understanding world model capabilities and limitations. Research on the cutoff for generalised Bernoulli-Laplace urn models analyzes the mixing time of Markov chains consisting of d urns, m colors, and dmn balls, where at each step balls are redistributed among urns based on a permutation drawn from a distribution on the symmetric group S_d [22]. The work shows that cutoff occurs whenever the chain on [d] corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, with the same holding for a labeled version of the model.\n\nThis mathematical analysis connects to world modeling through its relevance to understanding mixing and convergence properties of randomized algorithms. The results provide theoretical grounding for methods that rely on random sampling or Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, which are widely used in probabilistic world modeling and inference. The extension to card shuffling versions where cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters demonstrates how theoretical analysis can address increasingly complex modeling scenarios.\n\nSimilarly, research on the rigidity of projected perturbed lattices studies the occurrence of number rigidity and deletion singularity in point processes that generalize projections of perturbed lattices [@",

      "abstract": "Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is a common and increasingly significant way to refine the step-by-step reasoning of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.",

Through our teacher-student training paradigm, the model achieves a level of detail and generalization on par with Depth Anything 2 (DA2). We establish a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry and visual rendering. On this benchmark, DA3 sets a new state-of-the-art across all tasks, surpassing prior SOTA VGGT by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy.

In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologically trivial, can nonetheless serve as universal probes of the non-trivial topology of electronic Bloch bands, and any change in the local topological environment in an otherwise normal insulator in terms of mid-gap bound states in their vicinity. We theoretically establish these generic findings by implementing a minimal model Hamiltonian describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice, fostering such point defects. The defect-bound mid-gap modes are also shown to be robust against weak point-like charge impurities. Furthermore, we showcase experimental observation of such bound states by embedding ordinary crystal defects in two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy is used to reconstruct spectra and eigenstates. Our combined theory-experiment study establishes ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology that should be germane in crystals of any symmetry and dimension, raising the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near such defects in the bulk of topological superconductors and to emulate ordinary-defect-engineered topological devices.",

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime.

In this work we demonstrate Synference by training a neural posterior estimator on $10^6$ simulated galaxies, based on a flexible 8-parameter physical model, to infer galaxy properties from 14-band HST and JWST photometry. We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2>$0.99 for M$_\\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\\sim$1700$\\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques. We demonstrate Synference's ability to simultaneously infer photometric redshifts and physical parameters, and highlight its utility for rapid Bayesian model comparison by demonstrating systematic stellar mass differences between two commonly used stellar population synthesis models. Synference is a powerful, scalable tool poised to maximise the scientific return of next-generation galaxy surveys.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit.",

To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward function that balances the achievement of a desired end pose with impact minimization and the protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To make the policy robust to a broad range of initial falling conditions and to enable the specification of an arbitrary and unseen end pose at inference time, we introduce a simulation-based sampling strategy of initial and end poses. Through simulated and real-world experiments, our work demonstrates that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls.",

      "abstract": "Upcoming weak-lensing surveys will probe the matter distribution at a few percent level on nonlinear scales (k > 1 h/Mpc) where baryonic feedback from galaxy formation modifies the clustering of matter. Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.",

      "abstract": "The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100.",

      "abstract": "Gravitational wave detectors produce time series of the gravitational wave strain co-added with instrument noise. For evenly sampled data, such as from laser interferometers, it has been traditional to Fourier transform the data and perform analyses in the frequency domain. The motivation being that the Fourier domain noise covariance matrix will be diagonal if the noise properties are constant in time, which greatly simplifies and accelerates the analysis. However, if the noise is non-stationary this advantage is lost. It has been proposed that the time-frequency or wavelet domain is better suited for studying non-stationary noise, at least when the time variation is suitably slow, since then the wavelet domain noise covariance matrix is, to a good approximation, diagonal. Here we investigate the conditions under which the diagonal approximation is appropriate for the case of the Wilson-Daubechies-Meyer (WDM) wavelet packet basis, which is seeing increased use in gravitational wave data analysis. We show that so long as the noise varies slowly across a wavelet pixel, in both time {\\em and} frequency, the WDM noise correlation matrix is well approximated as diagonal. The off-diagonal terms are proportional to the time and frequency derivatives of the dynamic spectral model. The same general picture should apply to other discrete wavelet transforms with wavelet filters that are suitably compact in time and frequency. Strategies for handling data with rapidly varying noise that violate these assumptions are discussed.",

We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $Λ$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\\ln B = -0.57{\\scriptstyle\\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$σ$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\\scriptstyle\\pm0.10}\\,σ$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\\approx 2.95σ$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $Λ$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.",

We show that there is cutoff whenever the chain on $[d]$ corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, and that the same holds for a labeled version of the model.

We present the Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA), a lightweight module that performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final VAE decoding step. LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.",

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.",

      "abstract": "Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typically such transformations are implicit or unknown, making the direct link with the convex program impossible. On the other hand, (sub-)gradients with respect to the original variables are often accessible or can be easily estimated, which motivates algorithms that operate directly in the original (non-convex) problem space using standard (sub-)gradient oracles. In this work, we develop the first algorithms to provably solve such non-convex problems to global minima. First, using a modified inexact proximal point method, we establish global last-iterate convergence guarantees with $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-3})$ oracle complexity in non-smooth setting. For smooth problems, we propose a new bundle-level type method based on linearly constrained quadratic subproblems, improving the oracle complexity to $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\varepsilon^{-1})$.

While there are typically standard distances to adopt in a continuous space, this is not the case for combinatorial parameters such as graphs that represent statistical models. Existing proposals like the structural Hamming distance are defined on the graphs rather than the models they represent and can hence lead to undesirable behaviors. We propose a model-oriented framework for defining the distance between graphs that is applicable across many different graph classes. Our approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes the graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion. This induces a neighborhood structure, from which we define the model-oriented distance as the length of a shortest path through neighbors, yielding a metric in the space of graphs. We apply this framework to both probabilistic graphical models (e.g., undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs) and causal graphical models (e.g., directed acyclic graphs and maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graphs). We analyze the theoretical and empirical behaviors of model-oriented distances. Algorithmic tools are also developed for computing and bounding these distances.",

Both materials are close to a ferroelectric transition, but despite six decades of extensive research, pivotal questions regarding the nature of this transition and of the associated fluctuations remain debated. Here we combine inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across the strain-induced ferroelectric transition in STO and KTO. We find that the modes remain underdamped and at nonzero energy, consistent with a first-order quantum phase transition. We also reveal a strong violation of the well-known Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between the phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating KTO and STO, which is not captured by ab initio calculations and points to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions. In metallic STO, we uncover a first-order transition at a remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. The present work resolves several long-standing questions pertaining to the model systems STO and KTO and is relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons.",

      "abstract": "The improving multi-armed bandits problem is a formal model for allocating effort under uncertainty, motivated by scenarios such as investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves. Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $Ω(k)$ and $Ω(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances. Taking a statistical learning perspective on the bandit rewards optimization problem, we achieve stronger data-dependent guarantees without the need for actually verifying whether the assumptions are satisfied.",

      "abstract": "Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.",

Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.",

Matching the initial conditions thus fixes the beta function and wavefunction anomalous dimension to these orders.

Our core insight is that measurement expertise follows predictable compositional patterns that can be systematically automated. ArachNet operates through four specialized agents that mirror expert workflow, from problem decomposition to solution implementation. We validate ArachNet with progressively challenging Internet resilience scenarios. The system independently generates workflows that match expert-level reasoning and produce analytical outputs similar to specialist solutions. Generated workflows handle complex multi-framework integration that traditionally requires days of manual coordination. ArachNet lowers barriers to measurement workflow composition by automating the systematic reasoning process that experts use, enabling broader access to sophisticated measurement capabilities while maintaining the technical rigor required for research-quality analysis.",

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) enhances finding visibility for breast cancer detection by providing volumetric information that reduces the impact of overlapping tissues; however, limited annotated data has constrained the development of deep learning models for DBT. To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM. Extensive experiments show that M&M-3D surpasses 2D projection and 3D slice-based methods by 11-54% for localization and 3-10% for classification. Additionally, M&M-3D outperforms complex 3D reasoning variants by 20-47% for localization and 2-10% for classification in the low-data regime, while matching their performance in high-data regime. On the popular BCS-DBT benchmark, M&M-3D outperforms previous top baseline by 4% for classification and 10% for localization.",

We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.",

First, we answer a question raised by Barber by showing that the number of $k$-uniform MLCIFs on a ground set of size $n$ grows as a doubly-exponential function of $k$, which we identify up to a log factor in the exponent. Among these MLCIFs we identify $k$ specific MLCIFs -- which we call the canonical MLCIFs -- as being in a meaningful way the most important MLCIFs. Specifically, our second main result shows that the canonical MLCIFs are precisely those which can have maximum weight among all $k$-uniform MLCIFs under a non-trivial increasing weight function, and moreover that each canonical MLCIF is the unique $k$-uniform MLCIF of maximum weight for some increasing weight function. This gives an interesting generalisation of the Erdős--Ko--Rado theorem to a notion of size which places greater significance on some elements of the ground set than others.",
