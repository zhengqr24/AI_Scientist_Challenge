# The Evolution of World Models: A Systematic Mapping from Cognitive Foundations to Artificial Intelligence Systems

## 1 Introduction: The Conceptual Bedrock of World Models

### 1.1 Defining the "World Model"

A world model represents an internal representation system, whether instantiated in biological neural networks or artificial computational architectures, that captures the fundamental structure, dynamics, and statistical regularities of an external environment. This conceptual framework enables prediction, reasoning, and strategic planning by simulating potential futures without requiring direct environmental interaction. The core function of any world model centers on uncertainty reduction and free energy minimization through accurate prediction of action consequences and state evolution [1]. This predictive capacity forms the foundation for intelligent behavior across both biological and artificial systems, serving as the computational substrate that bridges perception to action through internal simulation.

The theoretical underpinnings of world models extend beyond mere pattern recognition to encompass genuine causal understanding of environmental dynamics. As articulated in the Resonance Principle, causal comprehension emerges specifically from predictive, resonant dynamics within stochastic systems [1]. This perspective challenges deterministic digital architectures and suggests that genuine world modeling requires systems capable of emergent phase synchronization—a property observed in biological neural networks but largely absent in contemporary artificial intelligence systems. The distinction between correlational pattern matching and true causal understanding represents a fundamental divide in world model capabilities, with significant implications for artificial intelligence development.

### 1.2 The Centrality of Prediction

Prediction serves as the primary mechanism through which world models generate value, enabling systems to anticipate future states and select actions that maximize desirable outcomes while minimizing potential risks. This predictive function manifests across multiple domains and scales, from low-level motor control to high-level strategic reasoning. In reinforcement learning contexts, world models function as internal simulators that allow agents to mentally trial actions before execution, dramatically improving sample efficiency and enabling more sophisticated planning [2]. The predictive capacity also underlies more efficient compression, as demonstrated by encoder-augmented causal decoder architectures that approach the information-theoretic limits of language modeling [3].

The mathematical formalization of prediction within world models connects to fundamental information theory principles. As established in entropy estimation research, language prediction faces inherent constraints from informational entropy intrinsic to language itself, establishing theoretical limits to model accuracy and compression efficiency [3]. This relationship between prediction quality and computational efficiency underscores why world modeling represents such a crucial capability—systems that can accurately predict their environments necessarily develop more compact, generalizable representations that transfer effectively across related domains and tasks.

### 1.3 Scope and Narrative of the Review

This review systematically maps the historical development and conceptual evolution of world models across multiple disciplines, analyzing forty representative papers that mark significant waypoints in this intellectual journey. Our trajectory begins with cognitive and neuroscientific origins, progresses through classical artificial intelligence and robotics formalizations, examines the transformative impact of deep learning, and explores specialized instantiations in physical modeling, reasoning systems, and diverse scientific domains. Each section provides detailed analysis of how influential papers approach the core challenge of world modeling, with particular attention to methodological innovations, theoretical contributions, and practical implementations.

The narrative arc reveals a consistent progression from explicit, hand-engineered representations toward learned, implicit models that extract environmental regularities directly from data. This transition mirrors broader trends in artificial intelligence from symbolic manipulation to statistical learning, while also highlighting enduring challenges in areas like causal reasoning, compositional understanding, and sample-efficient learning. By examining these developments systematically, we identify both the converging principles that unite diverse approaches to world modeling and the distinctive contributions that different disciplines bring to this fundamentally interdisciplinary problem space.

## 2 Cognitive and Neuroscientific Origins

### 2.1 The Helmholtzian Notion of Unconscious Inference

The conceptual foundations of world models trace back to 19th-century perceptual theories, particularly Hermann von Helmholtz's pioneering work on unconscious inference. Helmholtz proposed that perception operates not as passive reception of sensory data but as an active process of hypothesis testing against internal models of the world. This revolutionary perspective positioned the brain as constructing perceptual experience through Bayesian-like inference, where sensory inputs serve as evidence for evaluating internally-generated predictions about environmental states. The Helmholtzian framework established the core principle that organisms navigate their environments not through direct access to external reality but through constantly updated internal representations that probabilistically model causal structures.

This perceptual theory implicitly contained the essential components of modern world models: generative processes that produce predictions, comparison mechanisms that evaluate prediction errors, and updating procedures that refine internal representations based on mismatches between expected and observed outcomes. The mathematical formalization of these concepts would await 20th-century developments in information theory and Bayesian statistics, but the core insight—that perception and cognition rely on predictive modeling—established the foundational paradigm for understanding how biological systems interact with their environments. This perspective fundamentally reshaped understanding of brain function, positioning neural computation as primarily concerned with maintaining accurate predictive models rather than merely processing incoming sensory data.

### 2.2 The Computational Theory of Mind

The mid-20th century witnessed the emergence of the computational theory of mind, which provided the conceptual framework for formalizing world models as information-processing systems. Cognitive scientists like David Marr articulated hierarchical levels of analysis—computational, algorithmic, and implementational—that enabled systematic study of how brains might construct and utilize internal models. This computational perspective enabled researchers to abstract away from biological implementation details and focus on the fundamental information-processing challenges that any intelligent system must solve when building representations of its environment.

Within this computational framework, world models emerged as the central machinery enabling organisms to transcend stimulus-response patterns and exhibit flexible, goal-directed behavior. The key insight was that internal models allow systems to simulate outcomes without actual execution, dramatically expanding behavioral repertoire while minimizing costly trial-and-error learning. This simulation capacity proved particularly valuable for planning and reasoning in complex environments where actions have delayed consequences and multiple potential outcomes. The computational perspective also highlighted the tradeoffs between model complexity, accuracy, and computational tractability—considerations that would later become central to artificial intelligence approaches to world modeling.

### 2.3 Predictive Processing and the Free Energy Principle

Contemporary neuroscience has formalized these ideas through predictive processing frameworks and the free energy principle, which present the brain as a hierarchical prediction engine constantly updating its world model to minimize surprise. Karl Friston's free energy principle provides a unified account of perception, learning, and action under the single imperative of minimizing variational free energy—a mathematical bound on surprise. This framework positions world models as the central mechanism through which biological systems maintain their structural and functional integrity despite environmental uncertainty and change.

The Resonance Principle offers compelling empirical support for this theoretical framework, demonstrating through EEG analysis that causal understanding emerges from stochastic, resonant dynamics in neural systems [1]. The study analyzed high-density EEG data from P300 BCI tasks, computing the Kuramoto Order Parameter to measure global phase synchronization as an indicator of resonance. The findings revealed that while global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), trial-level analysis demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001), suggesting resonance serves as a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing to produce measurable event-related potentials. This empirical evidence supports the theoretical claim that phase synchronization constitutes a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding rather than merely a byproduct of neural activity.

The contrast between these neuroscientific findings and current artificial intelligence approaches highlights a significant gap in contemporary world modeling research. Biological systems appear to leverage stochastic, resonant dynamics for genuine causal understanding, while most artificial systems rely on deterministic architectures optimized for correlational pattern matching. This distinction may explain why current AI systems excel at tasks requiring statistical regularity but struggle with genuine causal reasoning and understanding. The Resonance Principle suggests that incorporating similar stochastic, resonant properties might enable artificial systems to overcome these limitations and develop more robust world models capable of true causal reasoning.

## 3 Classical AI and Robotics: The First Formalizations

### 3.1 Symbolic AI and Mental Models

Early artificial intelligence research approached world modeling through symbolic representations, where world knowledge was explicitly encoded in structured knowledge bases using formal logics and production systems. Systems like SOAR and ACT-R implemented comprehensive cognitive architectures that separated procedural and declarative knowledge while maintaining explicit world models that could be manipulated through symbolic reasoning. These architectures enabled sophisticated problem-solving and planning capabilities by representing world states as collections of symbolic propositions and actions as operators that transformed these symbolic states according to predefined rules.

The symbolic approach excelled in domains where comprehensive domain knowledge could be formally specified, such as mathematical theorem proving and constrained puzzle-solving environments. However, this methodology faced fundamental limitations when applied to complex, real-world domains characterized by uncertainty, partial observability, and combinatorial state spaces. The knowledge acquisition bottleneck—the difficulty of manually encoding comprehensive world knowledge—proved particularly challenging, as did the frame problem—determining which aspects of a world state change following an action. These limitations motivated the development of alternative approaches that could acquire world models directly from experience rather than relying on hand-engineered symbolic representations.

### 3.2 The Rise of Probabilistic Models

The recognition of these limitations spurred a shift toward probabilistic frameworks that explicitly represented and reasoned about uncertainty. Bayesian networks, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provided mathematical formalisms for treating world states as latent variables to be inferred from partial, noisy observations. These probabilistic approaches enabled more robust reasoning under uncertainty while maintaining interpretable, structured representations of environmental dynamics and dependencies.

The model-oriented graph distances framework provides a modern lens for evaluating these classical model structures, offering systematic methods for defining distances between graphical models based on their representational power rather than superficial structural differences [4]. This approach treats each graph as a statistical model and organizes graphs in a partially ordered set based on model inclusion, inducing a neighborhood structure that enables meaningful distance metrics in graph space. By applying this framework to probabilistic graphical models like undirected graphs and completed partially directed acyclic graphs, researchers can quantitatively compare different world modeling approaches and understand their relative expressive capabilities and limitations.

Probabilistic approaches significantly advanced world modeling capabilities, particularly in domains characterized by uncertainty and partial observability. However, they still faced scalability challenges in high-dimensional, continuous domains common in real-world applications. The curse of dimensionality limited their applicability to complex sensory domains, while the need for manual specification of model structure maintained elements of the knowledge engineering bottleneck that had plagued purely symbolic approaches. These limitations would eventually motivate the transition to learned representations that could automatically extract relevant structure from high-dimensional sensory data.

### 3.3 Embodied Cognition and Behavior-Based Robotics

A significant counterpoint to complex internal modeling emerged from embodied cognition and behavior-based robotics, most notably in Rodney Brooks' influential critique "Intelligence Without Representation." Brooks argued that explicit world models were often unnecessary for competent real-world behavior, proposing instead that "the world is its own best model." This perspective emphasized direct perception-action coupling through layered behavioral modules that operated without comprehensive internal representations. The subsumption architecture exemplified this approach, creating robust robotic behaviors through simple, reactive components rather than detailed internal models.

This embodied perspective highlighted situations where elaborate world modeling might be computationally wasteful or practically infeasible, particularly in dynamically changing environments where maintaining accurate models requires constant updating. Behavior-based systems demonstrated remarkable robustness and adaptability in many real-world scenarios, outperforming more computationally sophisticated approaches that relied on detailed internal representations. However, these reactive architectures faced limitations in domains requiring long-term planning, reasoning about unobservable states, or learning from limited experience—capabilities that ultimately require some form of internal modeling.

The tension between model-based and model-free approaches continues to influence contemporary world modeling research, with recent work often seeking hybrid approaches that leverage the strengths of both perspectives. The key insight emerging from this historical debate is that the appropriate complexity of world models depends critically on environmental structure, task requirements, and computational constraints—there exists no universally optimal approach across all domains and applications.

## 4 The Deep Learning Revolution: Learning Models from Data

### 4.1 From Hand-Engineering to End-to-End Learning

The deep learning revolution transformed world modeling from a primarily hand-engineering endeavor to a data-driven learning process. This paradigm shift enabled systems to acquire high-dimensional, latent representations directly from sensory inputs using deep neural networks, bypassing the need for manual feature engineering and explicit model specification. The key innovation was the development of architectures capable of automatically discovering relevant features and structures from raw data, allowing world models to scale to complex, high-dimensional domains that had previously been intractable for classical approaches.

This transition from programmed to learned representations dramatically expanded the scope of world modeling applications, enabling progress in computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and other domains where manual model specification was impractical. The end-to-end learning paradigm allowed systems to discover task-relevant representations directly from data, often revealing structures and features that human designers might not have identified. This data-driven approach also improved robustness to noise and variation, as learned models could capture the statistical regularities of real-world data more comprehensively than hand-designed representations.

However, this shift also introduced new challenges, particularly regarding interpretability, reliability, and sample efficiency. Learned world models often function as black boxes, making it difficult to understand their internal reasoning processes or identify failure modes. Additionally, the data requirements for training these models could be substantial, particularly in complex domains with rich dynamics. These challenges have motivated ongoing research into more sample-efficient learning methods, interpretability techniques, and approaches for incorporating prior knowledge into learned representations.

### 4.2 Generative Models as World Simulators

Generative architectures—including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, and diffusion models—emerged as fundamental engines for world modeling due to their ability to learn the underlying data distribution p(x), which implicitly captures the rules and regularities of the environment. By modeling the joint distribution over observations, these architectures can generate coherent samples from the learned distribution, effectively simulating possible world states. This generative capacity provides a powerful foundation for prediction, planning, and reasoning, as systems can mentally simulate trajectories without direct environmental interaction.

The Latent Upscaler Adapter exemplifies how generative world models can be scaled and refined to produce more detailed and coherent predictions [5]. This approach performs super-resolution directly on the generator's latent code before the final decoding step, integrating as a lightweight drop-in component that requires no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages. By operating in latent space rather than pixel space, LUA achieves nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time while maintaining comparable perceptual quality, adding only +0.42 seconds for 1024 px generation from 512 px compared to 1.87 seconds for pixel-space super-resolution using the same architecture. This demonstrates how efficient refinement of generative world models can enable scalable, high-fidelity simulation while minimizing computational overhead.

Generative world models have proven particularly valuable in model-based reinforcement learning, where they enable agents to learn complex behaviors with significantly improved sample efficiency. By training on historical interaction data, these models can predict future states and rewards, allowing agents to evaluate potential action sequences through mental simulation rather than costly environmental interaction. This approach has enabled progress in domains ranging from video game playing to robotic manipulation, demonstrating the practical value of learned generative models for decision-making in complex environments.

### 4.3 The Explicit World Model Paper: A Case Study in RL

The 2018 "World Models" paper by Ha and Schmidhuber provided a seminal architecture that explicitly separated world modeling into three distinct components: a variational autoencoder (VAE) for perceptual compression, a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDN-RNN) for dynamics prediction, and a simple controller for action selection. This modular decomposition established a clear blueprint for separating perception, dynamics modeling, and control, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization. The V component compresses high-dimensional sensory inputs into compact latent representations, the M component learns to predict future latent states given current states and actions, and the C component learns successful behaviors using the internal model as a simulation environment.

This architecture demonstrated that agents could learn complex behaviors entirely within learned world models, developing sophisticated strategies without direct environmental interaction once the model was sufficiently accurate. The approach achieved remarkable performance in challenging environments like car racing and maze navigation, often surpassing human-level performance while requiring orders of magnitude fewer environmental interactions than model-free approaches. The success of this explicit world modeling framework inspired numerous subsequent developments in model-based reinforcement learning and established a reference point for evaluating alternative approaches to learned world models.

The explicit decomposition also facilitated analysis of which components contributed most to performance and where failures occurred, providing valuable insights for improving world modeling architectures. Subsequent research has explored variations on this theme, including different representation learning methods, alternative dynamics models, and improved planning algorithms. The core insight—that separating perception, prediction, and control can improve learning efficiency and generalization—continues to influence contemporary world modeling research across diverse domains.

## 5 World Models for Physical and Geometric Understanding

### 5.1 Modeling 3D Geometry and Depth

Physical world modeling requires explicit representation of 3D structure and geometry to enable accurate interaction with the environment. Depth Anything 3 exemplifies modern approaches to geometric world modeling, using a plain transformer backbone to achieve spatially consistent geometry prediction from arbitrary views without architectural specialization [6]. This "minimal modeling" philosophy demonstrates that sophisticated geometric understanding can emerge from appropriately structured learning objectives rather than complex, hand-engineered architectures. The teacher-student training paradigm enables the model to achieve detail and generalization comparable to specialized architectures while maintaining simplicity and efficiency.

The approach yields two key insights for geometric world modeling: first, that a single plain transformer is sufficient as a backbone without specialized geometric inductive biases, and second, that a singular depth-ray prediction target obviates the need for complex multi-task learning. By establishing a new visual geometry benchmark covering camera pose estimation, any-view geometry, and visual rendering, Depth Anything 3 sets new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by an average of 44.3% in camera pose accuracy and 25.1% in geometric accuracy. These advances demonstrate how learned geometric world models can achieve robust 3D understanding from visual inputs, enabling more capable robotic systems and augmented reality applications.

Geometric world models face unique challenges compared to other domains, particularly regarding the integration of different sensing modalities, handling of occlusion and partial observability, and maintaining consistency across viewpoints. Approaches that learn geometric representations directly from data have demonstrated advantages in handling these challenges compared to traditional geometric modeling techniques, particularly in unstructured environments where assumptions of regularity may not hold. The success of methods like Depth Anything 3 suggests that learned geometric representations may play an increasingly important role in applications requiring sophisticated spatial understanding.

### 5.2 World Models in Physics and Cosmology

The world modeling concept extends beyond artificial intelligence to scientific domains where researchers build computational models of physical systems. In cosmology, analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra represent a form of world modeling that isolates the universal imprints of spatial curvature on the early universe [7]. These analytical templates, derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, capture how curvature modifies underlying dynamics through systematic shifts in dynamically relevant wavevectors. The resulting predictions include characteristic large-scale features—low-ℓ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns—that provide potential discriminants for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations, particularly in large-angle B-mode polarization spectra.

Similarly, research on baryonic feedback across halo mass uses cosmological simulations like IllustrisTNG as ground-truth world models to understand how baryonic processes modify the matter distribution [8]. This work quantifies how group-scale halos with log M₂₀₀m/h⁻¹ M☉ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression of the matter power spectrum, contributing most of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. Crucially, correctly reproducing the full suppression requires accounting for matter redistribution beyond the virial radius of each halo while enforcing mass conservation. These findings motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales where baryonic physics significantly modifies clustering.

These scientific applications demonstrate how world modeling principles apply beyond artificial intelligence to fundamental scientific inquiry. In both cases, researchers build computational models that capture essential aspects of physical systems, enabling prediction and reasoning about phenomena that cannot be directly manipulated or observed. The methodological parallels between scientific modeling and artificial intelligence world modeling highlight the fundamental unity of the representational challenge across domains—identifying compact descriptions that capture the essential dynamics of complex systems.

### 5.3 Probing Material Topology

World modeling concepts also appear in condensed matter physics, where researchers study how material properties emerge from microscopic structure. Research on ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology demonstrates how ubiquitous defects—vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs—can serve as universal probes of non-trivial topology in electronic Bloch bands [9]. Though these ordinary defects are topologically trivial themselves, they can reveal changes in the local topological environment through mid-gap bound states in their vicinity, as established through minimal model Hamiltonians describing time-reversal symmetry breaking topological and normal insulators on a square lattice.

This approach showcases how world modeling operates at multiple scales: at the microscopic level, electronic structure forms a "world model" that determines material properties, while at the experimental level, researchers build models to understand how perturbations reveal underlying structure. The experimental validation using two-dimensional acoustic Chern lattices, where precision-controlled hopping amplitudes are implemented via active meta-atoms and Green's-function-based spectroscopy reconstructs spectra and eigenstates, demonstrates the practical utility of this modeling approach. The findings raise the possibility of arresting localized Majorana modes near ordinary defects in topological superconductors, suggesting potential applications in topological quantum computing.

The cross-fertilization between world modeling in artificial intelligence and scientific domains illustrates how representational principles transcend disciplinary boundaries. In each case, the fundamental challenge involves building compact, predictive models of complex systems that enable reasoning, prediction, and intervention. The methodological exchanges between these domains—with AI borrowing mathematical formalisms from physics and physics adopting computational approaches from AI—highlight the productive interdisciplinary nature of world modeling research.

## 6 World Models for Sequential Decision-Making and Control

### 6.1 Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)

Model-Based Reinforcement Learning represents the field most directly concerned with learning and using world models—specifically dynamics models—for planning and policy improvement. Unlike model-free approaches that learn policies directly from experience, MBRL methods learn explicit models of environment dynamics, which they then use for mental simulation and planning. This approach typically offers significantly improved sample efficiency, as agents can learn from imagined trajectories rather than requiring extensive environmental interaction. However, MBRL introduces additional complexity, including the challenge of model bias—where inaccurate models can lead to poor policies—and the computational cost of planning using learned models.

The core innovation in modern MBRL involves learning accurate dynamics models from high-dimensional sensory inputs, which requires combining representation learning with dynamics prediction. Approaches like the explicit world model architecture demonstrate how this can be achieved through modular systems that separate perception, prediction, and control. Subsequent research has explored more integrated approaches, alternative model architectures, and improved planning algorithms that work effectively with learned models. These developments have enabled MBRL to scale to increasingly complex domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and complex strategy games.

A key challenge in MBRL involves balancing exploitation of the current model with exploration to improve model accuracy, particularly in regions where the model is uncertain. Various approaches address this challenge, including uncertainty-aware modeling, targeted exploration strategies, and methods that explicitly account for model error during planning. The successful application of MBRL to real-world problems requires careful attention to these issues, as model inaccuracies can lead to catastrophic failures in safety-critical applications.

### 6.2 The Outcome-Reward Problem and its Solution

A fundamental challenge in outcome-reward reinforcement learning for multimodal large language models involves the problem of unfaithful reasoning—trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning [2]. Self-Consistency Sampling addresses this issue by introducing visual perturbations and performing repeated truncation and resampling of initial trajectories; agreement among resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates [2]. This approach improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.

The methodological innovation in SCS lies in its use of consistency across multiple reasoning paths as a proxy for reasoning quality, effectively creating a more truthful reward signal that penalizes lucky guesses following flawed reasoning. This approach connects to broader principles in world modeling, particularly the idea that robust reasoning requires consistency across multiple perspectives or perturbations. By evaluating reasoning quality through agreement across slightly varied conditions, SCS provides a practical method for refining the internal reasoning processes of large models without requiring explicit supervision of reasoning steps.

The success of SCS highlights how world modeling principles can address specific challenges in training complex AI systems. The approach demonstrates that carefully designed training signals that leverage consistency and robustness can guide models toward more reliable reasoning patterns, even in the absence of direct supervision of internal processes. This methodology represents a promising direction for improving the reasoning capabilities of large models while maintaining the efficiency of outcome-based reward signals.

### 6.3 Learning Complex Motor Skills

World modeling plays a crucial role in learning complex motor skills, particularly in domains like robotics where trial-and-error learning in the real world can be costly or dangerous. The Robot Crash Course approach tackles the unique aspect of modeling falling dynamics, with the goal of reducing physical damage while providing control over a robot's end pose [10]. The method proposes a robot-agnostic reward function that balances achieving a desired end pose with impact minimization and protection of critical robot parts during reinforcement learning. To enable robustness to broad falling conditions and arbitrary unseen end poses at inference time, the approach uses simulation-based sampling of initial and end poses.

This application demonstrates how specialized world models can address specific challenges in physical interaction. By focusing specifically on falling dynamics—a scenario that most robotics research seeks to avoid—the approach develops targeted modeling capabilities that enhance safety and reliability. The success in both simulated and real-world experiments shows that even bipedal robots can perform controlled, soft falls, highlighting how targeted world modeling can expand the capabilities of robotic systems in challenging scenarios.

The methodology also illustrates the value of simulation-based training for developing physical world models. By leveraging simulated environments, the approach can explore a wide range of scenarios that would be impractical or dangerous to encounter in real-world training. This use of simulation as a structured data source for world model learning represents a powerful paradigm for developing robust physical interaction capabilities while minimizing real-world risks.

### 6.4 Optimization with Hidden Convexity

Many control and reinforcement learning problems possess hidden convexity, meaning that while they appear non-convex in their original parameterization, they can be reformulated as convex programs via nonlinear invertible transformations [11]. This mathematical property has significant implications for world modeling, as it suggests that many apparently complex learning problems have underlying structure that enables global convergence guarantees. Research on global solutions to non-convex functional constrained problems develops algorithms that provably solve such problems to global minima despite their non-convex appearance, achieving oracle complexities matching those for solving unconstrained hidden convex optimization.

The practical significance of hidden convexity lies in its assurance that local optimization methods can find globally optimal solutions for certain classes of problems, provided the optimization is conducted appropriately. For world modeling, this means that learned models and policies may be more amenable to reliable optimization than their surface complexity suggests. The development of algorithms that leverage this structure without requiring explicit knowledge of the convexifying transformation represents an important advance for practical applications where such transformations may be implicit or unknown.

The connection between hidden convexity and world modeling highlights the importance of understanding the mathematical structure of learning problems. By recognizing that many challenging optimization problems in control and reinforcement learning possess favorable underlying structure, researchers can develop more effective learning algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees. This mathematical perspective complements empirical approaches to world modeling, providing foundations for understanding when and why certain methods succeed.

## 7 World Models in Language, Reasoning, and Knowledge

### 7.1 Large Language Models as Conceptual World Models

Large Language Models function as immense, implicit world models trained on human knowledge and language, capable of predicting text and simulating conversations, narratives, and reasoning chains. Unlike specialized world models designed for specific domains, LLMs capture broad conceptual knowledge spanning countless topics and domains. This comprehensive coverage comes at the cost of precision—while LLMs excel at capturing statistical regularities of language and common-sense knowledge, they often struggle with precise reasoning, factual accuracy, and consistency.

The Instella family of fully open language models demonstrates how world modeling principles apply to language modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results among fully open models despite using substantially fewer pre-training tokens than many contemporaries [12]. The development of specialized variants—Instella-Long for handling context lengths up to 128K tokens and Instella-Math for reasoning-focused tasks enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning—illustrates how general world models can be adapted for specific capabilities. These developments advance the goal of open and reproducible language modeling research while providing transparent, performant alternatives to closed models.

The conceptual world models embodied in LLMs raise fascinating questions about the nature of representation and understanding. While these models clearly capture sophisticated patterns in human knowledge, debate continues about whether they genuinely understand the concepts they manipulate or merely exhibit sophisticated pattern matching. This philosophical question connects to practical concerns about reliability, interpretability, and reasoning capabilities, motivating research into methods for enhancing and evaluating the conceptual world models within large language models.

### 7.2 Enhancing Reasoning and Self-Correction

Socratic Self-Refine presents a framework for improving an LLM's internal reasoning world model through fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement [13]. The approach decomposes model responses into verifiable (sub-question, sub-answer) pairs, enabling step-level confidence estimation through controlled re-solving and self-consistency checks. By pinpointing unreliable steps and iteratively refining them, SSR produces more accurate and interpretable reasoning chains, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art iterative self-refinement baselines across five reasoning benchmarks and three LLMs.

The methodological innovation in SSR lies in its decomposition of reasoning into verifiable components, enabling targeted refinement of specific weak points rather than global resampling. This approach mirrors how human reasoners might identify flawed steps in an argument and focus correction efforts accordingly. The framework provides a principled black-box approach for evaluating and understanding the internal reasoning processes of LLMs without requiring access to internal model states or gradients.

Contrasting SSR with the black-box distillation of Generative Adversarial Distillation highlights different approaches to improving reasoning capabilities [14]. While SSR focuses on iterative self-refinement through decomposition and verification, GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game where the discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model. Both approaches demonstrate how world modeling principles can be applied to improve reasoning capabilities, albeit through different mechanisms—internal refinement versus adversarial distillation.

### 7.3 The Information-Theoretic Limits of Language Models

Know Your Limits connects world model fidelity to fundamental information-theoretic constraints, arguing that language entropy sets a lower bound on model accuracy and compression [3]. The research introduces encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. By demonstrating how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, the work shows that models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.

This information-theoretic perspective provides important grounding for world modeling efforts, establishing fundamental limits on what can be achieved through improved architectures or training techniques. The connection between compression and generalization offers a theoretical explanation for why models that approach the entropy of their training data generalize better—they necessarily capture the essential regularities while ignoring spurious correlations. This principle applies beyond language modeling to world modeling more broadly, suggesting that optimal models should capture the true entropy of their domains rather than overfitting to training data.

The practical implication is that entropy estimation provides a valuable guide for model development and training. By monitoring how closely a model approaches the estimated entropy of its domain, researchers can gauge whether further improvements are likely to yield benefits or whether the model is approaching fundamental limits. This perspective helps contextualize progress in world modeling, distinguishing between improvements that genuinely advance capabilities versus those that merely optimize within existing constraints.

## 8 World Models in Scientific Discovery and Specialized Domains

### 8.1 Cosmological Modeling and Dark Energy

World modeling principles find sophisticated application in cosmology, where researchers build computational models of the universe's large-scale structure and evolution. A Bayesian perspective on evidence for evolving dark energy demonstrates how model comparison techniques can evaluate competing cosmological models, revealing how preferences for dynamic dark energy models may primarily reflect their ability to resolve specific dataset tensions rather than genuine evidence for new physics [15]. The analysis shows that for the key combination of DESI DR2 BAO and Planck CMB data, Bayesian evidence modestly favors ΛCDM over dynamic dark energy models, contrary to frequentist significance measures.

This cosmological application illustrates how world modeling operates at the most fundamental scales, with researchers building increasingly sophisticated models of the universe's composition and evolution. The tension between different cosmological datasets highlights challenges familiar from other world modeling domains—how to reconcile conflicting evidence, how to balance model complexity with explanatory power, and how to distinguish genuine discoveries from artifacts of particular modeling assumptions. The comprehensive tension analysis employing five complementary metrics provides a methodology for identifying the specific sources of disagreement between datasets.

Alternative approaches to cosmological modeling include holographic dark matter, which proposes that dark matter arises not from particle physics but from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale [16]. Using the Ricci cutoff in a universe containing only baryons and radiation, this approach can account for dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to density. This theoretical framework demonstrates how radically different world models can account for the same observational data, highlighting the role of theoretical priors in scientific world modeling.

### 8.2 Quantum Computing and Information Processing

World modeling concepts extend to quantum computing, where researchers develop quantum algorithms for computing fundamental information-theoretic quantities. Quantum algorithms for computing maximal quantum f-divergence and Kubo-Ando means provide unified frameworks for estimating Renyi entropy, Von Neumann entropy, and matrix means [17]. These developments represent the natural extension of world modeling principles to quantum information processing, with potential applications in quantum machine learning, quantum error correction, and quantum-enhanced simulation.

The impacts of decoder latency on utility-scale quantum computer architectures highlight how classical computing constraints influence quantum world modeling capabilities [18]. The reaction time of classical electronics—the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine logical measurement outcomes and execute subsequent conditional operations—fundamentally limits quantum computer speed. For surface code-based architectures operating at 2.86 MHz stabilization frequencies, even sub-microsecond decoding speeds introduce substantial resource overheads, including approximately 100k-250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage and 300k-1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor.

These quantum computing applications demonstrate how world modeling operates across multiple levels of abstraction—from the quantum physical implementation through error correction to algorithmic applications. Each level presents distinct modeling challenges, with constraints at lower levels propagating to influence capabilities at higher levels. The integrated analysis of full-system quantum and classical resources provides a comprehensive perspective on the practical challenges of building large-scale quantum computers capable of implementing sophisticated quantum world models.

### 8.3 Materials Science and Condensed Matter Physics

World modeling enables significant advances in materials science, where researchers seek to understand how microscopic structure determines macroscopic properties. Research on uniaxial strain tuning of polar lattice vibrations in KTaO₃ and SrTiO₃ combines inelastic neutron scattering, Raman spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations to study the evolution of soft polar phonons across strain-induced ferroelectric transitions [19]. The findings reveal strong violations of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation between phonon energies and static dielectric permittivities in insulating materials, pointing to the presence of slow mesoscale fluctuations induced by long-range interactions not captured by ab initio calculations.

In metallic STO, the research uncovers a first-order transition at remarkably low critical stress, in qualitative agreement with recent theoretical predictions. These results resolve long-standing questions about these model systems while providing methodology relevant to numerous other materials with soft polar phonons. The integration of experimental techniques with computational modeling exemplifies how world modeling operates in materials science, with researchers building increasingly sophisticated models that connect microscopic structure to macroscopic properties.

Supernematic research demonstrates how geometric frustration in quantum systems can enforce global conserved quantities via non-perturbative tiling invariants, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to macroscopically phase-coherent states [20]. In a frustrated bosonic model on the honeycomb lattice in the cluster-charging regime at fractional filling, this mechanism protects a conserved global quantum number—the sublattice polarization Ñ = N_A - N_B. Quantum fluctuation drives spontaneous symmetry breaking of this global U(1) symmetry to result in a supernematic phase, establishing a route to novel quantum many-body states driven by combinatorial constraints.

## 9 Methodological Advances and Theoretical Foundations

### 9.1 Algorithmic Foundations and Guarantees

Strong theoretical foundations are essential for reliable world modeling, particularly in safety-critical applications. Research on the improving multi-armed bandits problem develops algorithms with stronger guarantees for allocating effort under uncertainty in scenarios like investing research effort into new technologies, performing clinical trials, and hyperparameter selection from learning curves [21]. The work proposes two parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bounds the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data, achieving stronger data-dependent guarantees without needing to verify whether assumptions are satisfied.

This research addresses fundamental challenges in sequential decision-making, where agents must balance exploration of uncertain options with exploitation of known good options. The improving bandits setting—where reward increases monotonically with diminishing returns—captures many real-world learning scenarios where repeated effort yields improving but eventually plateauing performance. The development of algorithms with improved worst-case guarantees while maintaining strong performance on well-behaved instances represents significant progress for applications requiring reliable decision-making under uncertainty.

The statistical learning perspective taken in this work—treating bandit reward optimization as a learning problem over algorithm families—provides a framework for developing robust decision-making strategies that adapt to problem characteristics. This approach demonstrates how world modeling principles can be applied to the meta-problem of algorithm selection and configuration, enabling more automated and reliable deployment of decision-making systems across diverse domains.

### 9.2 Mathematical Foundations and Analysis

Rigorous mathematical analysis provides essential foundations for understanding world model capabilities and limitations. Research on the cutoff for generalised Bernoulli-Laplace urn models analyzes the mixing time of Markov chains consisting of d urns, m colors, and dmn balls, where at each step balls are redistributed among urns based on a permutation drawn from a distribution on the symmetric group S_d [22]. The work shows that cutoff occurs whenever the chain on [d] corresponding to the evolution of a single ball is irreducible, with the same holding for a labeled version of the model.

This mathematical analysis connects to world modeling through its relevance to understanding mixing and convergence properties of randomized algorithms. The results provide theoretical grounding for methods that rely on random sampling or Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, which are widely used in probabilistic world modeling and inference. The extension to card shuffling versions where cards are labeled and their ordering within each stack matters demonstrates how theoretical analysis can address increasingly complex modeling scenarios.

Similarly, research on the rigidity of projected perturbed lattices studies the occurrence of number rigidity and deletion singularity in point processes that generalize projections of perturbed lattices [@
